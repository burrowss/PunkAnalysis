A Day to Remember,1958,And Their Name Was Treason,2005-05-10,"And shepherds we shall be
For thee my lord for thee
Power hath descended forth from thy hand
That our feet may swiftly carry out thy command
So we shall flow river forth to thee
And teeming with souls shall it ever be
In nomine patris
Et filli
Et spiritus sancti

You've sunk lower than I've ever seen
And even though you deserved this
I tried to catch your fall
I've grown so tired of your childish threats
Know that I'll never run from anything

And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive

Here's where we prove all your fairytales wrong
This all stops tonight
Swim in your sea of smoke
Until your lungs lose the fight
It's over
This all stops tonight
Or prove me wrong

What have you become through your jealousy?
You've threatened my life, my friends and family
This is your last wrong turn in your life
And this dead end leads to a blood bath
Your blood bath

And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive

Here's where we prove all your fairytales wrong
This all stops tonight
Swim in your sea of smoke
Until your lungs lose the fight
It's over
This all stops tonight
Or prove me wrong

You'll never stop us with your one-man army
We would burn him alive
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
If you're such a man then bring the fight
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
We would burn him alive
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
If you're such a man then bring the fight

This is me calling you out
You want to talk like a man, then be a man
Stop talking like you're something (We're paging 1958)
You always have so much to say but it's never to our faces
I'm right here (We're paging 1958)
We're all one and the same
We're moving on, and living our dreams (We're paging 1958)
We're all one and the same
We're moving on, and living our dreams (We're paging 1958)",https://images.genius.com/5886d6ad4ec194a19978a694f09511db.1000x1000x1.jpg
A Day to Remember,2nd Sucks,What Separates Me From You,2010-11-11,"FIGHT!

You're afraid, like I make my deals with the devil
You've been at it for years, but couldn't reach that next level
Let's keep it real, this is no competition to me
Even if everyone around you acts like they don't see

(Oh!) Is anybody else listening? Outta sight outta mind is what you'll always be
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest. I laid my life on the line so I expect nothing less from you

I speak the truth and everybody else knows it
So set your ego to the side and just get the fuck over it
Can't waste my time on hateful people like you
So keep wishing you were me and I'll keep making you have to

(Oh!) Is anybody else listening? Outta sight outta mind is what you'll always be
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest. I laid my life on the line so I expect nothing less from you

I just can't believe it's really come to this
Because without me, you would not exist

(Hey, hey!)
Still got something left to say
Only one in the world that I depend on is me
I need nothing from no one, I take what I need
Get a hold of yourself, and keep away from me

(Oh!) Is anybody else listening? Outta sight outta mind is what you'll always be
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest. I laid my life on the line so I expect nothing less from you",https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/A_Day_To_Remember_-_What_Separates_Me_From_You_-2010-.jpg
A Day to Remember,All I Want,What Separates Me From You,2010-11-15,"I'm always screaming my lungs out 'til my head starts spinning
Playing my songs is the way I cope with life
Won't keep my voice down
Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud
I like to keep things honest
I'm a safe bet like your life's staked on it, for real
I'd hate to keep you all wondering
I'm constant like the seasons
And I will never be forgotten man

Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
Keep your hopes up high and your head down low

Still got something left to prove
It tends to keep things movin' while everyone around me says
My last days are looming overhead
But just what the hell do they think they know?
I keep my head above the water, while they drown in the undertow

Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low

If you take it from me, live your life for yourself
Cause when it's all said and done, you don't need anyone else
C'mon!

So let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
Not a worry in the world, tell me was this all worth it?
I get what I want so everyone's always judging me
I'm not afraid of anything, I've got the whole world in front of me

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low

Keep your heads down low, keep your heads down low
Keep your hopes up high, and your heads down low",https://images.genius.com/62f66ec0ed9f719eb8e7ce330e1b7c0d.620x620x1.jpg
A Day to Remember,All Signs Point to Lauderdale,What Separates Me From You,2010-11-15,"I hate this town, it's so washed up, And all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck When will I find where I fit in?
2, 3, 4

Remember when I tried, I never strayed too far from you
Forever by your side, No matter what I was going through
But now I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me, guess, I was always wrong

I hate this town, it's so washed up, and all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck, When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town

Cause no one can understand, I just can't be tied down
Nothing comes between me and my plans
So now I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me, Guess, I was always wrong

I hate this town, it's so washed up, and all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck, When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town

And don't believe a word they're telling to you
Don't believe a word they're telling to you
They let me down, when will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town

My world cannot ever bring me down
Gave everything I had to turn it back around
Cause our time's worth something, Bigger than both you and me
I can't live my life always backing down
I gotta do this right, then they can't make a sound
Cause I'm not here for nothing, Least I can say I stand for something
(You and me, we stand for something)

I hate this town, it's so washed up, and all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck, When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town

And don't believe a word they're telling to you

A Day to Remember,Another Song About The Weekend,Homesick,2009-02-03,"They keep playing sad songs on the radio
And I feel like I'm so alone
On this 15-hour drive
And all the while I tell myself to just believe
Cause nobody can give so much
And never get anything
(never get anything)

Everyone I used to know
Says they don't know what I've become
But I'm still the same
Not much has changed
I still know where I came from

I fell asleep with the lights on
And I can see that you're the first one in a long time
That had some faith in me (have faith in me)
Tell my friends we won't be long
The Florida sun begs me to come back home
And it feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me

And all the while I say too much of what I think
And I can't remember what it's like to find meaning in anything
For the life of me

Everyone I used to know
Says they don't know what I've become
But I'm still the same
Not much has changed
I still know where I came from
And all I ever wanted was so far from what I need
I'll write my songs, they'll sing along, and hope time heals everything

I fell asleep with the lights on
And I can see that you're the first one in a long time
That had some faith in me (have faith in me)
Tell my friends we won't be long
The Florida sun begs me to come back home
And it feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me

This is all I have!
This is all I have!
It's my life
This is all I have!
This is all I have!

I fell asleep with the lights on
And I can see that you're the first one in a long time

Pick your poison
Live with remorse
Don't forget that this is a choice
Pick your poison
Live with remorse

I could burn a hole with my eyes that cuts straight through the skin
No more love, no more resolution
It's getting harder bearing the darkness within
I gotta let it out
I'm gonna let it

I can feel your bad vibrations
All around me
All consuming
Corrupting all that I am
This pain is a sickness looming over me, and I can't escape it
Casting shadows that continue to shape who I am on any given day

It's like a fog surrounds me applying pressure within
Weighing me down, seeing in double vision
It hits so hard I stu- stu- stutter my speech
Ya go kinda cold inside
Dancing on thin ice

I can feel your bad vibrations
All around me
All consuming
Corrupting all that I am
This pain is a sickness looming over me, and I can't escape it
Casting shadows that continue to shape who I am on any given day
This pain is a sickness looming over me, and I can't escape it
Casting shadows that continue to shape who I am on any given day

A Day to Remember,Best Of Me,Common Courtesy,2013-10-08,"What'd you expect from me?
It's not my fault you'll never be happy
Just 'cause you're right doesn't mean I'm wrong
Our days were numbered and we knew it all along
Can't you let things be?
Now all that's left is misunderstandings
Spent my nights wishing I was gone
My dad was right, we will never get along

So I'm done, 'cause things could never be the same
This is the last time, this is the last time you'll ever burden me

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
Stretched myself out way too far
Now I can see you for who you are
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
It's all finally making sense
You took what's left of my innocence
Oh no
I can't believe you got the best of me

Can't you act your age?
Is it that hard to say what you're thinking?
Lately my life's moving way too fast
You'd drag me down if I'd let you hold me back
What a mess you've made
And you hide from it at the bars you frequent
Blamed myself avoiding time this cost
But looking back you only learn from what you lost

So I'm done, 'cause things could never be the same
This is the last time, this is the last time you'll ever burden me

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
Stretched myself out way too far

You took what's left of my innocence
Oh no
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe you got the best of me

I will never be the one you want, no I will never be the one you want
Finally come to terms that I can't stop, no not this time. (Ye-yeah)
I will never be the one you want, no I will never be the one you want
Finally come to terms that I can't stop, no not this time

I can't believe you got the best of me

A Day to Remember,Better Off This Way,What Separates Me From You,2010-11-15,"I wonder if you’ll notice, If they lock me up and throw away the key
Try to be open minded, you’ve got a lot to learn in the ways of me
You always got to say something
I’m none of your concern but you won't listen at all
You know I’d rather say nothing
And just be proud of myself for tearing down these walls

When you fall I’ll be the only one who looks away
When you call I’ll be the first to tell you I can’t stay
It’s all over, I found a better way to help keep you from me
I’m better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh
I'm better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh

You gotta keep this coming
Tell it like you know it but you don’t know nothing
Your call, we can settle this like gentlemen
Or meet me out the back to end it all and start again
My whole life’s spent waiting
Ever since I can remember been anticipating your fall
And God let it be a long one
Can’t let go of my grudge till I know you’re done

When you fall I’ll be the only one who looks away
When you call I’ll be the first to tell you I can’t stay
It’s all over, I found a better way to help keep you from me
I’m better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh
I'm better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh

You want it, you’ve got it
You’ve always been such a waste of time
You want it, you’ve got it
A friend of yours is no friend of mine
You want it, you’ve got it
When will you act your age
You want it, you’ve got it
You’re the reason things have to change

Woah-oh, woah-oh
You’re the reason things have to change
Woah-oh, woah-oh

When you fall I’ll be the only one who looks away
When you call I’ll be the first to tell you I can’t stay

A Day to Remember,Bullfight,Bad Vibrations,2016-07-23,"What a waste, I see you now and then
But mostly we pretend we're not more strangers than we're friends
Then we say, what we need to say, to try and get away from the tension we create

Why can't we say the things, the things we wish we would?
Why can't we laugh the way, the way we know we should?
Fall under the weight of all the pressure that's misplaced
Flaws that I embrace

Everybody sees your head’s hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness
Everybody sees your head’s hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness

I get
I get
I get so misunderstood

Something changed the way we interact
Now we can't get it back
Another relic of the past (Relic of the past)
Makes you think, did I ever know you at all?
Follow until I fall
Vultures circling in the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun

Why can't we say the things, the things we wish we would?
Why can't we laugh the way, the way we know we should?
Fall under the weight of all the pressure that's misplaced
Flaws that I embrace

Everybody sees your head’s hung low

You can't just avoid the issue
You should've learned from the things we've been through
You don't know what you have until it’s lost
Till the hammer drops

Brace, fall
Brace, fall

A Day to Remember,City of Ocala,Common Courtesy,2013-10-08,"Fuck yeah!

Remember way back when? They said this life was a dream
Well it still is, I never wanna wake
Standing in my backyard at our old practice space
Hard to hold back the tears from streaming down my face

This is our corner of the world
Where we can come to be ignored
This is our point where we return
This is where I came from

Remember way back when? This place seemed bigger to me
Learned how to play guitar, and made my mom watch me
We always knew back then, just where I'd be right now
We never questioned it, was more like when and how

That was then, this is now
You can't run before you go learn how, and you won't

This is our corner of the world
Where we can come to be ignored
This is our point where we return

This is what made us who we became
Where they know me, not just my name
There's not another place the same
This is where I came from

You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us
Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough
Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around

A Day to Remember,Heartless,And Their Name Was Treason,2005-01-22,"For once my eyes are open to you, and everything you've said
For once your web of lies is in the open
I gave you everything I had, until I had nothing left
Still you act as if I'm just a burden
I've finally let go. Let go, let go

Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on
Cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart
I've been around the world and back for you, and now it's time to choose

I've been swallowed by this wreck that you call your life
I'm damaged from the inside. I've been broken
Don't threaten me with what you think I feel
If you could read my mind you'd be in tears

I'm sick of your excuses you hold above me
I've finally come to terms with what I am
I'm nothing in your eyes, and this will not change
I'm living in a dream

Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on
Cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart
I've been around the world and back for you, and now it's time to choose

And I'll close my eyes, and dream of a better time
When I'll be finally past this and I'll be happy on my own
I've done all I can, and I've still been cast aside
All I ever wanted to be was be the one who would wipe tears from your eyes
But I guess I'll play second best, to a world that will never care about you
You'll never understand you're just another pretty face
You'll tell me that you care, and then run straight back to him
I can hear your voice of treason from a mile away

You never did know how to whisper

You're such a liar. Tell me the truth
You're such a liar. Tell me the truth
You're such a liar. Tell me the truth
Do the world a favor, stop cutting your arms, and slit your throat",https://images.genius.com/9523064929f233d8e7189716c279bbe2.1000x1000x1.jpg

A Day to Remember,If I Leave,What Separates Me From You,2010-11-15,"Let's go!

In the beginning, I was upfront
Nothing to think about, you'd always hear me out
We made a pact and never gave up
When everything would change
We'd always stay the same
Something went wrong along the way
You come around and there's nothing left to say
It's like we're strangers anyway
What more could you ask of me

It's been a long time coming
But everyone's going to hear me out

If I leave bet you'll wish I stayed
Make you regret all the things you said to me
You know that time can't help us now
If I leave this, if I leave this way

I've always been a man of action
Never let anything keep a hold of me
Could always tell when something's missing
Like I knew everything, except for you and me
I can't make you want to stay
God knows I tried, but this broke under our weight
I still gave it everything, I guess I'll never catch my break

It's been a long time coming
But everyone's going to hear me now

If I leave bet you'll wish I stayed
Make you regret all the things you said to me
You know that time can't help us now
You know that time can't help us now
If I leave I shall move away
And try to right all the wrongs we've ever made
Won't let your problems weigh me down
If I leave this, if I leave this (way)

Never thought you'd be the last one standing
Never thought that we would come this far
You'll always be there looking over my shoulder
I've come to terms with exactly what we are

But I'm still chilled to the bone
The mind plays tricks this time of year in Florida
It's not the time to be alone

I feel to understand it starts from the inside
And I feel that patience is a lesson learned in time
To be good with your own life's to be good with mine

Time stands still this time of year in Florida
The only time I feel at home
The neighborhood kids run down the road in Florida
It's got me scared I missed the boat

I feel the less you love the less you feel alive
I feel to understand it starts from the inside
And I feel that patience is a lesson learned in time
To be good with your own life's to be good with mine
To be good with your own life's to be good with mine

I always knew that I would leave
But I didn't think it'd change a part of me
Can't get back to who I was back then (who I was back then)
Feels wrong to shut that out
Seems wrong to pretend
To pretend

I feel the less you love the less you feel alive

I remember when I first saw the country
I remember sleeping in the van
Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand
I remember jumping off of cliff tops
I remember playing with no one there
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been
Cause where I've been

They wonder why I hide myself from everyone
From everything, man come on
You wouldn't last a day as me
Everyone loves me for my past, but they always hate me in the present
Why can't you just meet me somewhere in the middle?
It's in the hardest times we grow the most

Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand

Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been
Cause where I've been

Side glances around this crowd all at me
There must be something I can't see, so tell me
Hold me up, help me out
As I circle around what makes me happy
There isn't one place that I can be without leaving
This is my life

Said goodbye to friends and family, cause they could never understand

I remember the coast of California
I remember trucks stops cross the land
Never kept too many idols cause we were busy being them
I remember waking up in Georgia. I remember quitting my last job
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I was, where I've been

A Day to Remember,Naivety,Bad Vibrations,2016-08-19,"What I hate about getting older
Where's my naivety?
Wonder when I'm gonna get taller
Where's my naivety?
Thinkin back when we were younger

Don't wanna live by fear of failure
Where's my naivety?

Somehow lost along the way

This is me

I’ve got no apologies
I'm done chasing things that don't belong to me
This is real
It's how I feel
With one shoulder on the wheel
What I'm searchin for grows further out of reach

What I hate about getting older
Where's my naivety?
Wonder what it's like not bein sober
Where's my naivety?
Lookin back when we were younger
Every mistake was a chance that we could take
Now I think I'm just gettin colder
Where's my naivety?

It got lost along the way

I'm waitin for what's next
And I won't let it slip away
Get me through another day

Wasn't the plan when I built it out

In unison when I bite my tongue
Escape, at long last
Burn the bridge never looking back

Your words made everything drag on and on
I finally found her, and when I did I just couldn't make things right

What the fuck am I doing?
I can't tell the difference from wrong and right
I second-guess my decisions
Cause I haven't been this person in my whole life

No need for second opinions
I do the best I can to ruin what I have, come on

Don't think you've got to go in alone here

You're dying, just make up your mind

I thought this was what you wanted
Someone who gets everything right
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone to put you first in their life
Cause we're running out of time

I saw pictures from the new year
Here's a moment that's not as bad
This wasn't part of my vision
The optimistic me says we can make this last, but no
You ruined my favorite records
Listen to them and I think of you
I just hope you remember

A Day to Remember,Right Back at it Again,Common Courtesy,2013-10-08,"We’re﻿ coming out swinging!

Started out in the spring of 2003
Never went to school, nobody talked to me
Except to tell me all the things I couldn’t do
Don’t want to hear about it
Got with my guys packed into all our cars
Hit all the nearest scenes, and every local bar
I played a show a night 'till it made me sick

So here I am, I’m right back at it again
Just like I’ve always said, if you're too cool for school
You ain’t here to make no friends
And﻿ I said hey (hey)
I’m right back at it again
Just like I have always said, you’re too cool for school
I ain’t here to make no friends

Left home with no kinda backup plan
And everyone one that we knew that we couldn’t stand
Said ""If you can’t﻿ make it here, you won’t make it there""
Don’t want to hear about it
Spent most of our nights sleeping on hardwood floors
People's living rooms, in any open door
Played a show at night 'till it all made sense

Don't wanna hear about it
Don't wanna hear about it, yeah

So here I am, I’m right back at it again
Just like I’ve always said, if you're too cool for school
You ain’t here to make no friends
And I said hey!
I’m right back at it again
Just like you’ll always say, you’re too cool for school
I ain’t﻿ here to make no...
Brace for impact

Don't wanna hear about it
Don't wanna hear about it
Bitch...

Something is so off!
Can we leave it this time?
What did you think?
I thought it was awesome. Leave the 'bitch' please?
You like the 'bitch?'

And right then I knew that everything had changed
A whole side of you that went missing’s gone
And all I'd thought of you is wrong
Gotta step away for perspective
Need to take a chance to clear my head
Don't wanna understand your position
Oughta wash my hands of you and run
Think I lost my nerve, like I lost you
Held trapped by what we were
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
Spent time today reminiscing
Think I learned a lot about who we are
Couldn't diagnose your condition
But now I see the signs you left behind
Think I lost my nerve, like I lost you
And the truth remains unheard
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you

I always leave empty handed; I can't keep the things that mean the most to me

I might be temporarily blind but I'm not stupid

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face? (I've always wanted to know)
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place. (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it. I don't get it. Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down

I'd give you everything but that would never be good enough and that's alright with me
You take me for granted. I tried to help you be who you wanna be
I'm a sucker for a complication
Here goes another week it must seem
You weren't worth my time, you weren't worth my time
I still let you take it from me

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face? (I've always wanted to know)
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place. (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it. I don't get it. Nothing ever seems to work when you're around

Always depending on everyone else
You know it's going to drive me crazy

Who cares what you're saying, if no ones listening
You don't have to like me, but you're gonna respect me

I got no regrets, but have my days with doubt
To those left in sadness I'll be the one to lead you out

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable
Reserve my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgment
You don't make me who I am
I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable
Reserve my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgment
You don't make me who I am

God help those who help themselves
And forget about everyone else

God help those with open hands
May they never feel burdened again

A Day to Remember,Violence (Enough Is Enough),Common Courtesy,2012-12-21,"I've been feeling like everything is for nothing
In fact, I've never felt so goddamn small
Always searching for the bright side
To find the strength for when I fall
I'm still believing that life has a meaning
Can't cope with thinking that there's not
I'm so divided that I try to hide it
It's the only real thing that I've got

So, when the world outside can't see what's wrong and right
People can't understand the reasons that we fight
Something's gotta give

Violence, give me violence
Cause they say (say) we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down
Violence, give me violence
Cause they say (say) we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

You can call this a warning (it's a warning)
That we're drowning in our malcontent
Tear me down like a cancer (whats your answer?)
We're different and it makes you sick
There is a sadness here, on every corner
It's in our hearts, dear God
Don't wanna trouble you much
But we all need to know when enough is enough

So, when the world outside can't see what's wrong and right
People can't understand the reasons that we fight
(Reasons that we fight)
Something's gotta give

Violence, give me violence
Cause they say (say)we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down
Violence, give me violence
Cause they say (say) we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

You only get one chance and that's one too much
What's the world gonna say when I call your bluff, punk?
Bow your head

Violence, give me violence
Cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down
Violence, give me violence
Cause they say (say) we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance

Having no time to myself is the only way I can fight it
When I'm alone it's like I'm staring into a mirror
Don't know the person inside it and that's never been any clearer
I miss your family and I miss all our friends
If you had it to do over would you do it over again
Cause I would, this meant something more to me
There's a hole in my heart where you used to be

I still wish you the best of luck, baby
And don't go thinking this was a waste of time
I couldn't forget you if I tried

You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I’ll live with regret for my whole life

I confess that I brought this all on myself
Condemned to suffer alone, like there's nobody else
When you're gone, it's like a whole part of me’s missing
So I'll keep living the lie and just hope that you're listening
I tried to make us a life here
But our foundation was built on sand
No time to run until the damage was done
And I’ve never had the upper hand

I still wish you the best of luck, baby
And don't go thinking this was a waste of time
I couldn't forget you if I tried

You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I’ll live with regret for my whole life

All the things you love are all the things I hate
How did we get here in the first place?

I play it cool but it's hard to be (All my trust)
Is slowly burning inside of me (Over what)
There can't be anymore progress, I know our fate
The only thing that can heal this is time and space

You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside

She means the world to me, so hold your serpent tongue

You create a world I don't want to see
And your forest's a stand of dead trees lost in the night
Did you ever think you'd live down the past
You just want to tie yourself to the mast

At least in your mind

Learn to swim in rushing rivers
Breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm

This shitty guitar needs some personality
This shitty song needs some personality

Your hollow accusations no one ever hears
Your wounded senses of pride, a guilty souvenir
All your protests and vacant excuses ring insincere
(This song needs some fucking personality)
I just want to find a car to overturn
I just want to light a fire to watch it burn
Now we're past the point of no return and no one is here

Learn to swim in rushing rivers
Breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm

This song needs some fucking personality
Anybody? Somebody?
Give me some fucking personality!
What happened to personality?

You are afraid
Uneducated on where this would lead
Going on for far too long
We are sorry for the greed
Leave us in pieces and places
War-torn and wronged
In between whispers and screams
You permeate my soul
Lost between nightmares and dreams
You decimate this home

I'm too depressed to go on

I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault

Cause you were driving me crazy

Bite your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know? I'm here to stay

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I hear are the many echoes of
The darkest words you said
And it's driving me crazy
I can't find the best in all of this

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I... I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I... I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
I said I'm sorry I'm a bit of a let down
But all my friends are daring me to come over
So I come over and over and over
So let me buy you a drink
And we'll pretend that you think
That I'm the man of your dreams
Come to life in a dive bar
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason

Save me from myself the way you used to
’Cause I don't really like myself without you

A little numb, maybe I can't feel at all
You stitch me up but you can’t stop me bleeding out
I'm better when I'm broken

I love you, but I hate you when you're with someone else
And I want you wrapped around me, but I don't trust myself
I drove by your house, but you don't live there anymore

This heavy burden

There's a halo in the distance

Up in smoke with the fire we started

Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow

In the dark awake, and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)

Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm
And you never really know where it goes up until it starts
I got my eye on you
Whatcha gonna do
Day dream near a stream with the linear bites
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night
And I can't picture you but I sure got the feeling right
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl

And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news
And you reached for my hand, I was scared in your room
We fell on the floor and we started to move
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop
Up my back they would climb just as I came unglued

She said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be there to try it again

Nineteen as we roll across the bedroom floor
Your eyes they cannot lie as you're dreaming of our future home
And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl

In the rain with the drink from the back of the bar
I would raise up my voice, you would raise it up more
We'd forget that our lives being apart, it is hard
We'd thought we were close but it still feels far
Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars
If we learn to forgive and accept who we are

You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to do it again

Wait a minute, hold up a second
Don't leave me here with this feeling
Like I'm the one full of regret
Like I never did good for us both
Like you never did pull out that weapon
And stick that knife in my back
Was I supposed to accept it
When your words are like
More than just sticks and stones
Kinda like a bullet
A hollow tip that lodged in my bones
And I can't just swallow it
My pride is more than all that I own
So I gotta give it away
And some of the times I'm all the way wrong
But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along
To the song I write til I'm alone at night
And I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
Cause I know that me and you is just only right but one one one one...

It's a cry from the past, we have been through a lot
Every year has been great and a few have been tough
And your kids, they will reach for the stars up above
We'll sit and relax as we're cheering them on
The ropes to the light from the crib to the grave
We started alone, in the end we're okay

You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine

Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
With the radio on and a new black eye

And I guess you really got me now

Just a drunken bike messenger on Tuesday night

Fell on to the table as the neighbors just stared
We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
Digging with our hands in the dirt outside
And she dragged me to the edge of town
And she slapped me, then she pulled me down

Spending all night getting lost together

,The Party Song,Enema of the State,1999-06-01,"Here you go motherfuckers

Do you wanna come to a party
My friends picked me up in a truck at 11:30
This thing's at a frat house
But people are cool there
Reluctant I followed
But I never dreamed there
Would be someone there who
Would catch my attention
I wasn't out searching
For love or affection
So I payed my three in
And the girls got in free
Shined the beer for tequila
And we headed into the party

And then in the backyard
Some terrible ska band
Someone in the background
Was doing a keg stand
This place is so lame
All these girls look the same
All these guys have no game
I wished I would've stayed
In my bed back at home, watching TV alone
Where I'd put on some porn
Or have sex on the phone
Far from people I hate
Down from Anywhere State
Trying to intoxicate girls
To give them head after the party

And then I saw her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She wasn't wearing underwear
At least I prayed that
She might be the one
Maybe we'd have some fun
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
But that night I learned some girls try too hard

(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
And some girls try
Too hard to impress with
The way that they dress with
Those things on their chests and
The things they suggest to me

I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
The names she was dropping
The games she was playing
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Flys
How she's down with
The wise well-constructed disguise
Now I'd rather go dateless
Than stay here and hate this
Her volume of makeup
Her fake tits were tasteless
So I said I'd call her
But never would bother
Until I got turned down
By another girl at a party

So when you see her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She won't be wearing underwear
And you'll discover
This girl's not the one
And she'll never be fun
So you should just turn and run
Because you'll find out that
Some girls try too hard

(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
And some girls try
Too hard to impress with
The way that they dress with

She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me

I wore cologne
To get the feeling right
We started making out
And she took off my pants

And are still more amused by TV shows

What's my age again?

On the drive home
I called her mom
From a payphone
I said I was the cops
And your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me

All came to spill their guts

And we spoke
About the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
And which Psalms we had loved the most

Some die looking for a hand to hold

All my nerves have been worn to the threads
I only honestly have one or two left
I got my faith, I got my family
I got a wire fence around my whole stake
If I believe only half what I read
I got a reason to be dug in deep

It's revelation saying
Don't come running to me
When they're coming for you

I seen those boys kissing boys
With their mouth in the street
But I raised my son to be a righteous man
I made it clear to him what fear of God means
I'd hold him down under Tompkins Lake
Before I ever let him go to the wolves
The path we walk is only narrow and straight
No son of mine will wander astray
Abomination

Don't come running to me when they're coming for you
(Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)
Don't come running to me when they're coming for you

Last night I heard a voice that said, “Don't give up your gun”
They keep washing right up on those shores
Man they're gathering their numbers up
Those bleeding hearts come marching down my road
Well I'll be waiting right here at my door
It's a lie to say it wouldn't be fun
If you're joining them then I got one
With your name on it

Don't come running to me when they're coming for you

And cut the nooses they tie for our necks

You constantly make it impossible to make conversation
Keep us comatose but audible
And I like it the farther I get out
We pass it off but it's all on us
Only common conversation
It took everything I got
And I like it the farther I get out

I'll speak my mind whenever I feel slighted

Kept clean and they will let you breathe

So I sat alone and waited out the night

So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around
I'm not writing my goodbyes

I submit no excuse
If this is what I have to do
I owe you every day I wake
If I could I would shrink myself
And sink through your skin to your blood cells
And remove whatever makes you hurt but
I am too weak to be your cure

Know we do this cause we care
Not for the thrill

That everyone who lives will someday die
And die alone

I read more maps than books

Is another chance I should have took

I'm an old abandoned church with broken pews
And empty aisles
My secrets for a buck
Watch me as I cut myself wide open

Oh, I would kill for the Atlantic

At midnight in torrential downpour

And I feel sort of almost like there's too much going on. There are all different kinds of meetings going on. Stuff on experimental psych and therapy, chemical aspects. All of it
But, I'm... while I don't mind having all this going on inside of me. It's sort of... I think I'm going to be relieved when it's over. When I can sort of settle back down

For I am uncaught and still swimming alone in the lake
Shimmering under a moon
 made in anger and haste
Shimmering like a penny
 out of reach in the
 subway grating
 
1 2 3 4

5 6 7 8

Shimmering like a coin kept safe away
You never listen to anything
We could leave it alone
I’m sure there’s someone who knows
Where you’ve been

""You could never work well with our group
Not with the faults we've found
So we've fixed you with cement galoshes
And no one can save you now
Unless you have friends among fish
There’ll still be no air to breathe
You could drink up the entire ocean
We’ll still find someone to be everything
We know that you’ll never be""

So touch me or don’t
Just let me know—
Where you been?
Or we could leave it alone
I’m sure there’s someone who knows
Where you’ve been",https://images.genius.com/36f95df47a89048ef4ac3cc4178fbab4.901x901x1.jpg

Come gather now, and lay this beast to rest
I kept hearing trumpets, got my hearing checked
My father spoke of prophecy
To think that I believed is self-centered of me
There was something I was trying to say
But then I choked on it, and now it's getting kind of late

We walked to the edge but we never leapt
What sings to you when you disconnect?

Written on the wall
The letters plain and tall
This is my own fault
We don't feel anything!
We don't feel anything!
We don't feel anything!
We don't feel anything!
I still cower at eternal wrath, though
Don't want my fear to become my shadow
I want to evade my thoughts
I want to die in Kyoto

The ocean never sleeps or dreams
It never stops to ponder what it sees
Committed to its satellite
No one can move you, man, and no one's ever gonna try

All the tides are married to the moon
All I want is for my heart to be as true

Written on the wall
The letters plain and tall
This is my own fault
We don't feel anything
Not gone, but fading fast
So let me put to rest
The only question that you'll ask
We don't feel anything!
We don't feel anything!
We don't feel anything!
We don't feel anything!
We don't feel anything!
We don't feel anything!

We go slow when we first make our moves
By five or six, bring you out to the car
Number nine with my head on the bar
And it's sad but true, out of cash and IOUs
I got desperate desires and unadmirable plans
My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent
Bring you back to the bar, get you out of the cold
My sober straight face gets you out of your clothes
And they're scared that we know all the crimes they'll commit
Who they'll kiss before they get home

I will lie awake and lie for fun
And fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say
Barely conscious in the door where you stand
Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands
You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute
I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do
And your hair smells of smoke
Who will cast the first stone?
You can sin or spend the night all alone
Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start
If you let me have my way, I swear, I'll tear you apart
Cause it's all you can be
You're a drunk, and you're scared
It's ladies night, all the girls drink for free

It was a quarter past four in the morning
When the storm broke our second anchor line
Four months at sea
Four months of calm seas
To be pounded in the shallows off the tip of Montauk Point
They call 'em rogues, they travel fast and alone
One hundred foot faces of God's good ocean gone wrong
What they call love is a risk
Cause you will always get hit
Out of nowhere by some wave
And end up on your own

The hole in the hull defied the crew’s attempts
To bail us out
And flooded the engines and radio
And half-buried bow

Your tongue is a rudder
It steers the whole ship
Sends your words past your lips
Keeps them safe behind your teeth
But the wrong words will strand you
Come off course while you sleep
Sweep your boat out to sea
Or dashed to bits on the reef
The vessel groans
The ocean pressures its frame
To the port I see the lighthouse
Through the sleet and the rain
And I wish for one more day to give my
Love and repay debts
But the morning finds our bodies washed up 30 miles west

They say that the captain stays fast with the ship
Through still and storm
But this ain't the Dakota
And the water's cold (so cold)
Won't have to fight for long

(This is the end)
This story's old but it goes on and on
Until we disappear
(This is the calm)
Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed
While you were underneath
(We are the risen)
I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains
Sunk below the sea

I spoke the words but never gave a thought
To what they all could mean

A funeral keeps both of us apart
(Washed up on the beach)
You know that you are not alone
I need you like water in my lungs

And though our kids are blessed

I dare you to say they taste the same
Let the leaves fall off in the summer
And let December glow in flames
Erase myself and let go
Start it over again in Mexico
These friends, they don't love you
They just love the hotel suites, now

I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery

Oh, take a chance, let your body get a tolerance
I'm not a chance, but a heat wave in your pants
Pull a breath like another cigarette
Pawn shop heart trading up, said no
I'm the oracle in my chest
Let the guitar scream like a fascist
Sweat it out, shut your mouth
Free love on the streets, but
In the alley it ain't that cheap now

I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I don't care what you think

Bulletproof loneliness at best, at best

If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you

Collect the bad habits that you couldn't bear to keep
Out of the woods but I love
The tree I used to lay beneath, kissed teeth stained red
From a sour bottle baby girl with eyes the size of baby worlds

Pulling out their fragile teeth
And clip their tiny wings

So only say my name

Have fanned the flame
Maybe I’ll burn a little brighter tonight

I see through you when we’re sitting in the dark
So give me your filth
Make it rough
Let me, let me trash your love

I will sing to you every day
If it will take away the pain
Oh and I’ve heard you got it, got it so bad

I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides

,The Drunk History of Fall Out Boy,,2014-12-25,"It’s summer of 2001; Joe meets Patrick and he’s like “Yo, I know about music.”
And Patrick’s like “Yo, I know more about music.”
""That’s impossible! Do you wanna start a band?”
And Patrick’s like, “…Yeah… That’s cool.”
And then he’s like “Yo, this is a book store, it's not a music store!”
And then they met at Patrick’s house. And Patrick’s wearing shorts and socks and a hat. Patrick is playin’ drums for some fuckin’ reason! And Pete’s there for some reason! They start playin’ music together. And they're like “Oh, let’s play some fuckin’ covers from some other bands!” It was like, Green Day and fuckin’ Misfits and fuckin’ Ramones!
Pete said to Joe, “Yo, we gotta change this shit up! Yo, we’ve played all these bands; let’s play shit from Fall Out Boy.”
And so Pete and Patrick are like “Yo, that’s dope. But we need a fuckin’ drummer!” Because Patrick’s playin’ drums and he’s a singer!
Patrick's like “Yo! I got a soul voice!”
And they're like “Wait, how do you have a soul voice?”
And he’s like “Yo, watch this: Yeah!”
And they’re like “Oh my god! That sounds like soul!” So they put it in the song and it was like “WHERE IS YOUR BOY TONIGHT!”
And then they’re like: “Yo, that's fuckin’ perfect. This is Fall Out Boy.” And they made records like, Evening Out With Your Ex-Girlfriend. Evening Out With Your Ex-Girlfriend, everybody loves it.
It's called Evening Out With Your Girlfriend.

With Your Ex-Girlfriend! It's called Evening Out With Your Ex-Girlfriend!
It's called Eating Out Your Girlfriend, and it's real and it doesn't matter.
And Pete talked to Patrick and Joe and he was like “Yo, what the FUCK! Yo, this is gonna be fuckin’ DOPE!”
So they made a record, and it was called: Take This To Your Grave.
They made it without a drummer! And they had like three, four drummers come in.
The four drummers they had come in were like: Josh Freese, Neil Peart, the dude from Toto… The fourth one was like the guy from Papa Roach or something.
And they were like, “Yo, we need Andy Hurley. Andy Hurley. Take This To Your Grave. Fuckin' record it.” And he did it, and he killed it.
He was like, Bigadigadigalalululapssshhhh!
Killing the skins! Tapping the skins! Tapping the rims! Playing the shit! Killing these bitches! Wrapping it out!

(You're getting a fucking tattoo right now! What the fuck is going on?!)
“We should get signed, to Fueled by Ramen. 'Cause these guys know what the fuck is going on.”
And they were like “Yo, if you can make our scene any bigger than it is, which is not fuckin' hard, we will sign you guys.""
Pete was like ”Yo! We got this record that’s fuckin’ dope, dude! It's called Take This To Your Grave.“
Hey, it's gonna be called From Under The Cork Tree, it's gonna be fuckin' huge.
And then Patrick’s like ""I gotta keep it real, I gotta keep it artistic. These are three songs that are gonna make the album and it's called (burp), this is called: 'Thnks fr th Mmrs,' '20 Dollar Nose Bleed,' and 'Sugar, We're Goin' Down.'
And they made this record that was fucking dope and it fucking hit on the charts.
Like: one, two, three! Three, two one! Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! TEN TO ONE!
From Under The Cork Tree sold like, four million records!
Ten million records!
Fifteen million records!
And Brendon Urie had nothing to do with the entire record. And Patrick was like “That's good!”
Pete was like “Yo, fuck you! I can do whatever I want!”
Joe was like “Yeah, it's cool man, whatever… I don’t give a shit.” And then Andy was like “Eh… Cool!”
And Pete was like ""Makeup is fuckin’ great for a guy. Because it makes a guy look beautiful. Which a lot of times, a guy is not beautiful. And I wanna change that. I wanna make sure everybody thinks that guys are beautiful.""
(-I'm good so far.
-You wanna spit one more time?
-Yeah, I do.
...Shut the fuck!..)
Pete was like “Oh my god, I’m so embarrassed about this dick pic!”
And then I saw the dick pic, and I was like “Eh, it's not bad. It's not a bad dick. Let’s be real.”
We made Rolling Stone one issue before Fall Out Boy. And Fall Out Boy made the issue right after us and they were so pissed!
They were like “Yo, fuck you guys!”
They were like “Yo! Panic has the fucking cover of Rolling Stone? Yo, fuck these dudes! We're gonna fucking go miles above! We're gonna hit every fucking continent there is known to man!”
But they didn’t! Because they missed a second of time.
Apparently, they were like: “Oh, shit we got every continent.” And they didn’t actually hit it.
Dude, Pete was like ""What the FUCK?”
Oh, you didn’t fuckin’ make the continent. It's like, fuck you!
So From Under the Cork Tree happens, we fuckin' have three, four years of awesomeness!
Like people are cumming on themselves, 'cause it's so big!
So Fall Out Boy was like, so Patrick’s like “Yo, we're gonna name this record From Under The Cork Tree and From Infinity On High.”
Pete was like “Yo, Folie à Deux means the Theatric of Two.”
Fall Out Boy was like “Yo, we gotta take a break” meaning, Pete was like “Yo, we gotta take a break bro”
And Patrick’s like, “I need time for my music! Uhhh!”
And Joe's like “Yo, I need time to find the fuckin’ art dude I gotta find some fuckin’ meau-metal.”
And Andy’s like “I’m just gonna play with some fuckin' metal bands.”
And they were like, “Alright, this breaks been like three years long. Two years long.
Three years long.
Three and a half?
We gotta fuckin’ come back man. We gotta come back strong!
(-You took my beer away, what the fuck?!
-No, you poured it all over yourself!
-Yeah, you poured it on yourself, man.)
We gotta make this shit legit. It's gonna be fuckin' dope. It's gonna go fuckin' sky high. We're gonna make a fuckin' record that sails the skies.
We're gonna call this record: Save Rock and Roll.
So they made ""Alone Together"", ""Light 'Em Up"", ""Alone Together"", ""Phoenix"".
And everyone’s like “What the fuck? You’re working with this guy who fuckin' recorded Avril Lavigne and P!nk!”
(-What the fuck is this on my shirt, did I puke on my shirt?
-No, you poured beer all over yourself.
-Oh god...)
Pete was like: “Yo, we're gonna end up on the tour with Panic! At The Disco and Twenty Pilots.”
(Burp, spit)
And that’s all. And that’s all that matters. And that is how the fucking story goes.",https://images.genius.com/7b3f27d01143b86b6dd55ecfebbbde4f.500x487x1.png
,The Kids Aren’t Alright,American Beauty/American Psycho,2014-12-15,"Stuck in the jet wash
A bad trip I couldn't get off
Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead

And in the end

Make us poster boys for your scene

Of my hand, 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am
The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the diehards

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Or am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

I don't care if you don't care!
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care!
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care!
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care!
I don't care!

Everyone's so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia

Land of make believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make believe (Sons, it's another lie!)
And I don't believe
And I don't care
(Woo, woo, woo) I don't care
(Woo, woo, woo) I don't care
(Woo, woo, woo) I don't care
(Woo, woo, woo) I don't care
IV. Dearly Beloved

Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure

Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse
V. Tales of Another Broken Home

To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies

I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
The lights of masochists

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time


I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain when you've been victimized
Tales from another broken home
You're leaving
You're leaving
You're leaving
Ah, you're leaving home",https://images.genius.com/aed51210d64a9bcb61dc8f16ed3f0b30.1000x996x1.jpg

Look out to the setting sun, the brink of your vision
Eternal youth is a landscape of a lie
The cracks of my skin can prove, as the years will testify
Say your prayers and light a fire, we're gonna start a war
Your slogan's a gun for hire, it's what we waited for
Hey, Gloria, this is why we're on the edge
The fight of our life's been drawn to this undying love

Gloria! Viva la Gloria!
You blast your name in graffiti on the walls
Falling through broken glass that's slashing through your spirit
I can hear it like a jilted crowd
Gloria! Where are you, Gloria?
You found a home in all your scars and ammunition
You made your bed in salad days amongst the ruins
Ashes to ashes of our youth

She smashed her knuckles into winter (Gloria!)
As autumn's wind fades into black
She is the saint of all the sinners (Gloria!)
The one that's fallen through the cracks
So don't put away your burning light!

Gloria! Where are you, Gloria?
Don't lose you faith to your lost naivety
Weather the storm and don't look back on last November
When your banners were burning down
Gloria! Viva la Gloria!
Send me your amnesty down to the broken hearted
Bring us the season that we always will remember
Don't let the bonfires go out!

So, Gloria, send out your message of
The light that shadows in the night
Gloria, where's your undying love?
Tell me the story of your life
Your life!",https://images.genius.com/ba93f3590b346230e1c96bb4cc257b5f.1000x1000x1.jpg

Of love and razor blades, your blood is surging

Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the Salvation Army
There is no place like home when you got no place to go

Little girl, little girl, your life is calling
The charlatans and saints of your abandon
Little one, little one, the sky is falling
Your lifeboat of deception is now sailing
In the wake, all the way, no rhyme or reason
Your bloodshot eyes will show your heart of treason
Little girl, little girl, you dirty liar
You're just a junkie preaching to the choir

Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the Salvation Army
There is no place like home when you got no place to go

The traces of blood always follow you home
Like the mascara tears from your getaway (Gloria!)

Is your home where you lay your head or where your fake swordfish is mounted?
Eyes-cross, habitually I would leave the room prematurely with a tiny little pile of dark roast grounds where I once stood just enough there to keep me safe
Rained-out, wrapped right up in our metaphorical overpriced ponchos
Endless rides home, circling the block for the whisper of a word we didn't know how to use in a sentence
Saw you
Went home
Drank myself silly in the basement alone, and the spiders were showing off a sense of humor on the ceiling, spinning letters together
I read “ we keep you safe.""
Lost art, lost boy watching a grown man drink a 211 at 11 a.m. Our old joy!

It feels like I am finally closing my eyes after a year and a half long day, and I am tired as hell

Catch me wasting away, or whatever
Spend all my time, confined to home
Forget what you said, why bother?
I'll never forget you said...

This Is all so surreal
What is this place?
So many mirrored faces, but not a single name
And ""it's alright"", I sing it everyday; one thousand times, one thousand ways

Catch me wasting away, or whatever
Spend all my time, confined to home
Forget what you said, why bother?
I'll never forget you said

Everyday, I walk away
But I don't get very far
I know your every secret
I know your every sound
But here I stare on from the fence
As a hungry bloodhound
Pretending in unending joy
To hate to be alone
To adore the great unknown
When all I know is you
And all you are is gone
The words don't sound the same
When we speak over the phone
Father stop to ask a question
Haven't seen this place since last election
New kids all in deviant hairdos
Spilling beer on family heirlooms
The guys would like, to go out tonight
But I don't know if I care to
Your hands are on my shoulders
Your hands are on my neck
Your eyes meet mine, suggesting
That I should not be upset
At Heathrow, there will be no band
If murder is his mind
One run to stock white wine
And as I sunk to sleep
My hampered heart did pine
I should not say I love you

You've got a certain who-knows-what about you
And I've got a small amount of time
To figure out what it is exactly and to whom does it apply

Covered in bottles with the stench of loss of life

Lots of things you kind of ignored
And brushed it off, you always brushed it off
Pacing down the hallway stairs
Mental notes of quick repairs
To gaps in my story for tomorrow morning
Of why I was up at this hour
(you owe me)
When I have children of my own
And when they have children of their own
I’ll spit and spew of my dumb ass high school endeavors
With prideful tone (I wish they were so much better)
But when my freezing lower limbs approach that sly grinning little shit
I knew the truth in every vowel sound that I had admitted just two nights before
Goodbye was not an option
It’s clear to you but to no one was it clearer than to me
Since day one I’ve been locked in
I’m not fucking hanging up

That crooked nose
No, those fellas stick around too long
Perpetuating every pathetic word that I skew into song
She was my trophy shelf of slip ups
My untamed hormonal Loch Ness shitshow
On late night rotation for months on end
A brick boot swimming lesson
In the deep end of my adolescence
Scrawling notes on the backs of my hands
But I'll start fresh with you
Extracting the rusted attachments
Keeping the diehard nuts, bolts, and screws
We'll go from square one
With the wit of an old pro
And you can fill in the gaps with whatever you know

Drunk and worthless, spewing bullshit all across the stage
Wake up and we find new hiding places
Trying desperately to escape

Crawl down 'em on hands and knees in a heart beat
If I had to, I own 'em that at the very least

I noted every stride, I guess the rain hit before the ink could dry
And where I thought I'd be, was not what I perceived
Assessing the progress from beneath your sheets

You’d tell them where and when
You never thought I’d leave the east coast
We were young and full of sin
And I too dumb to understand
Yet I’ve loved you forever
At least that’s what I tell Holt
When I’m too drunk to lie, too drugged to be alone
You suggested I write a song about the first time we met
Well I don’t wanna remember there or then
So, is this the hook you wanted?
Is it stuck inside your head?
Can you sing it with your friends, or alone?
So, am I what you needed?
Say you love me to my face
Grin and gossip, walk away and then go…
So is this the hook you wanted?
To sing about me to my friends?
Well you’re just stuck inside your head, all alone
You were all I needed
Said I loved you to your face
But you just laughed and walked away",https://images.rapgenius.com/6329ac9244e06d414ef74a3b9e5a5b54.1000x1000x1.jpg

Take a stand, man

Making my way to hipster with glasses
Was a little more than just nerve wrackin'
Kinda’ just counted on her to turn me into goo
Praise Whatever it ended with a smile
Cause for a bit, a tad, a little while
I expected you two, to save the day with sly remarks
Like ""he's so cute"" and ""whatever you want""s
Though the white jacket didn't fit
The friends I came with did, perfectly
Snugged right to my body
Like sad movies and late night drinks
Could’ve guessed by the end of the hour
There was more than just a little smile on my face
Covered in custard and cookies and cream
Pissed off I had to leave
But all has to end
You got a smile that could light this town
And we might need it
Cause it gets dark around here
Real dark around here
Most of my old friends
I can only stand for the weekend
But that doesn't apply here
Doesn't apply here
The day started with a bloody drip
And a taste on my lips
That was a lot less than desired
Awkward moments to the side
Not all expiring fast
A tank top that didn't cover a thing
And a zipped down hoodie
Zipped to the bottom
Had us laughing every time
No matter how many chest hairs there were in sight
You got a smile that could light this town
And we might need it
Cause it gets dark around here

And lose my mind a little bit
Nicky and Jackson saved my smile and I feel home
Joseph's running
To tell me something
I feel older but I am so sure it's a lie

When I was eighteen
I could not love her
I was always thinking of the one she left behind
I retraced her picture
To fit inside of mine
But she was naked and misshapen and confined

Now I don't see her
She loves another
And in my bright I thought I had it figured out
But I'm still tracing
And I'm erasing
And somewhere sleeping I read words that have my doubts

Maybe he'll give it a go
Then I'll be free to just evaporate, disperse, or implode
Picking at holes in my jeans
There's so much God in my gene pool
Not feeling lonely, I just like being alone
I've called ""A"" through ""F"" already, but no one knows
Why one girl, one band, two paychecks are more than I can handle
Mathematically that can't be more than one end of a candle
Bottom of the ninth, can't find my socks
Lord knows
I'm stuck between two good things, but I just wanna get out

Just walking in circles, replaying high school songs in my head

In a curiously well-kept house built before I was born
This year we're gonna stamp out the sorry feeling
Rain on summer vacation
Five blocks from Tasker-Morris Station
Fucked for the ride home if I can't find two bills
To rub together before

Midnight rolls around
I thought you heard me sing your spirit sound
But you turned in early
Left the TV flickering its staged romance across your face
Said goodbye from the front porch
I always wonder if you're smiling at us or if you're looking away
I'd ask, but either way I feel sorry for you
Locked your love in a screenshot
They all work that way
And I've been wishing I could say that I don't
The selfish side likes to think my execution's more
Of an honest one
These artists all cut cloth with underscored conviction
Blacked out, friction flies me back to Baltimore
To wait for you but I'm stuck here too

Until midnight rolls around
I thought you heard me sing your spirit's sound

I thought of caring
As a reason for some to praise me, in envy
“So humble and kind”
“No better person”
Now that I’m older I’ve seen what I’ve been
Ruthless, ungrateful, always trying to turn up tracks
Be it about me or you
Seeking out the faithful in me
With tricks of trust and gluttony
I don’t wanna wait for anyone
When I was younger I thought of deep space
Pick me up swiftly, carry me away
Drop me off willing, light years long gone
Never again seeing those who I loved
It’s not about me this time - there I go lying again
Please save my soul
I don’t know what I’m doing anymore
Seeking out the faithful in me with singles and a pen
Is it possible I’m overthinking this
It’s not what I’m not, it’s what I believe in
It’s not what I’ve got, it’s my peace of mind
Too early to see if I’m still in the past
Too hopeful to be wasted time
It’s not what I’m not, it’s what I believe in
It’s not what I’ve got, it’s my peace of mind
Too early to see if I’ll be
Seeking out the fraud in me

Stood out for hours as you complained
About how you haven't seen your friends yet
That you're too drunk to stand and
You not knowing if you can love him forever
Bullshit, you fucking miss me
There, I said it, I guess I'll talk to you in a few months
Sitting drunk on the sidewalk
I guess I'll get up
I guess I'll go for a walk
Press my shoes against the pavement
I swear this has gotta be the hundredth
Time I've thought of you tonight

You weren't the only one
Who thought of us that way
I spend most nights awake
Wide awake
I never thought that I
Oh I would see the day
Where I'd just let you go
Let you walk away
Where I let you walk away

Used to call you a crook, called you a bandit
There ain't no other good damn reason why
My heart, it would go missing
For so many months so I was wishing that you
That you would stop pretending
Remember all those countless nights
When I told you I loved you?
And to never forget it
Oh, just forget it

A kiss goodbye, your twisted shell
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet
Let's say goodbye, the hundredth time
And then tomorrow, we'll do it again

I never thought it'd be this way
Just me and you, we're here alone
And if you say, all I'm asking for is
A thousand bodies, piled up
I never thought would be enough
To show you just what I've been thinking
And I'll keep on making more
Just to prove that I adore
Every inch of sanity
All I'm asking for is
All I'm asking for is
All I'm asking for

These hands, stained red
From the times I have killed you and then
We can wash down this engagement ring
With poison and kerosene
We'll laugh, as we die
And we'll celebrate the end of things
With cheap champagne

Without, without a sound
Without, without a sound
And I wish you away
Without a sound
And I wish you away
Without a sound, without a sound
And I wish you away
Without a sound, without a sound
And I wish you away
Without a sound, without a sound

Counting your face among the living

Up and down escalators
Pennies and colder fountains
Elevators and half-price sales
Trapped in by all these mountains

Running away and hiding with you
I never thought they'd get me, here
Not knowing you changed from just one bite
I fought them all off just to hold you close and tight

But does anyone notice? But does anyone care?
And if I had the guts to put this to your head
But would anything matter if you're already dead?
And should I be shocked now, by the last thing you said?
Before I pull this trigger, your eyes vacant and stained

Come on and feel that shame

We'll never let you go

For what you've done, they're gonna find
A place for you and just you mind your manners when you go
And when you go, don't return to me, my love""
That's right

Mama, we all go to hell
Mama, we all go to hell
It's really quite pleasant, except for the smell
Mama, we all go to hell

Mama! Mama! Mama! Oh!
Mama! Mama! Mama! Ma...
And if you would call me a sweetheart
I'd maybe then sing you a song
But there's shit that I've done with this fuck of a gun
You would cry out your eyes, all along

We're damned, after all
Through fortune and flame, we fall
And if you can stay, then I'll show you the way
To return from the ashes you call
We all carry on
When our brothers in arms are gone
So raise your glass high, for tomorrow, we die
And return from the ashes you call",https://images.genius.com/23c0dc0c254bda53c93e044b6b66eb74.640x640x1.jpg

Wipe off that makeup, what's in is despair

You can find out, first hand, what it's like to be me
So gather 'round, piggies, and kiss this goodbye
I'd encourage your smiles, I'll expect you won't cry

Here's my resignation, I'll serve it in drag

I can't pin down the year
When the romance wasn't dead
And love still stood for something
There was a girl who'd lost her way
She blushed red when he came over
And they danced the night away
And he sung as he drove her home and
It was there that she would say
""If I could, then I would save you""
And he smiled and turned away
In six weeks they're saying ""I do""
Oh, love just don't go that way no more

And like the seed becomes the tree;
We take shape of a family
We grow and we change
And face the rain like you wouldn't believe
And through it all
We're standing tall
And I just don't say it enough
If not for you, no we wouldn't be standing at all

And now it's nineteen-ninety-sumthin'
How the hell did we end up here?
Four kids and a few jobs later
And the pictures fill the pages
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But you'd be a fool to give it up
'Cause you know that what we've got is bigger than the two of us
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But it's bigger than the two of us
And I will hold you in my arms
When you feel like giving up
Love just don't go that way no more

From the ambulance that day

The heart attack was sharp
He didn't feel no pain
If you saw him now then what
What would you say?
I love you and I miss you
I owe you everything
And I hope you know you saved me (Saved me!)

Oh mother
Mother please don't cry
'Cause you know I miss him too
I didn't even say goodbye
And though he's gone, I know he's gone
He lives on in all of us
And I will hold you when you cry

“I miss her.”
We still talk like everyday
But we don’t talk in the same way that we used to
I’ll move on and forget you
We could never see eye to eye
But either way

I like her ‘cause she’s smart, headstrong and independent
She puts me in my place, but I don’t know where I stand
And if only I could find the words, or muster up the nerve to tell her
I’ll never forget her
And she’ll always have a part of me

Don’t let me go down this road again
We both know where this ends
In a storm of feeling, I’m so unappealing
I can’t play these games

I like her ‘cause she’s smart, headstrong and independent
She puts me in my place, but I don’t know where I stand
And if only I could find the words, or muster up the nerve to tell her

And she’ll always have a part of me
She'll always have a part of me
She'll always have a part of me

I was falling for a girl who would ask me to come over
Just for a day, when her parents were away
Now all I can do is lay in my room
Fall asleep, dream of you
Then wake up and do nothing about it

I fell for a boy who could never ever let me walk home that way
‘Cause you gotta be safe
So hold back your views
We’re both leaving soon
I can’t fall back on you
‘Cause that’s not what I do

I fell for a boy who could never ever let me walk home that way
She hates it when I shout these words but, I’ll still sing for you
'Cause you gotta be safe

But these nights are too long to shake off
My nerve to easy to break
A brave face is too hard to fake
Stressed out and I'm losing the will
I'm too hot but I'm feeling the chill of defeat
This happens every time
Push the boundaries 'til I tow the line

I'll find my feet
Save my skin and hopefully
Crush the doubt in my head
To work this out in the end
I've been crossing out the lines
And I've been wasting all my time
Questioning myself again
With ink that's trapped inside this pen
Ignore and push to the side
Plays on in the back of my mind
The right words are too hard to find
Keep cool and wait for a sign
No good, just good for nothing
This path must lead to something
Worth the doubt, the stress, the effort
I always knew I could never cut the pressure

I'll find my feet
Save my skin and hopefully
Crush the doubt in my head
To work this out in the end
I've been crossing out the lines
And I've been wasting all my time
Questioning myself again
With ink that's trapped inside this pen
Thinking back to the days when nobody knew my name
It was so easy to escape
My careless mind was a safer place
Always asking why can't bring myself to even try
Holding out till the end
Fake a smile and pretend
Oh, but there's still time to get these wounds to open wide

Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Til then I walk alone

I'm walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines, what's fucked up when everything's alright
Check my vital signs, to know I'm still alive and I walk alone

Drawn to the light in the distance
Holding her hand while she listened
She told him how much she would miss him
Said his goodbyes to his children
And let the weight fade away

I have your hands
But I have my mother's eyes
Your tact and poise
And her sense of wrong and right
Heard you awake in the middle of the night
Letting go of the things you keep inside

Worked your fingers to the bone
To be sent home with a cardboard box
Filled with everything you've known
All things come to be loved and lost

I'll keep a moment sealed in time inside a picture frame
A small reminder of the days I thought would never change
They always say it's clear to see
How parts of you shine through in me
I think you know, you won't be here forever
And you're counting down the days
'Til you can rest your tired eyes and let it slip away

The lessons learned at your side
Will stay with me all my life
The man I hope to become, I know is deep down inside
I know, you don't even need to say
I know you're proud in your own way
I know you're proud in your own way

And you watched me grow up
As I watched you grow older

But this shipwreck, it is mine

And where I make my grave, my anchor lays

I've been wasting away
But in a town with no way out
There's not much else to do anyway
If you're looking for a place to decay
Then there will always be a place in my town called revelry

I've seen a punch or two, narrowly escaped a few
And if you can get the day off, I could show you a view
I remember the football games
The first time that I got laid
And the time J broke his finger drinking by the lake

Day by day, we grew to love this place
And where I make my grave is where my anchor lays
The sound of my youth echoes out through these empty streets
I guess I can't kick up the roots;
It's home, and that's the truth

Can we start it all again
And go back to when we were both wrong?
'Cause we're both wrong

I kinda wish I just stayed home
But Friday night is boring on my own

Stumbles defenseless through the door
Her dirty tricks hid up her sleeve
She's done this a thousand times before
You can brag, you can gloat
Eat your words, hope you choke
But the grass on your side doesn't seem so green
All the shit that you spoke
Will you sink? Will you float?
Will you hang by a rope from the old oak tree?

She's a mess
She's a waste of time
Damsel in distress on a steep decline
When all she wants is someone to keep her warm
Maybe I'll walk home on my own to sleep it off
And think about some things as I stumble through the dark
But the only glimpse of me in her I could see
Was in her left wing mirror staring back at me
Now you're at home I guess you're alone again
It's 5am as she stumbles to bed
Plays out thoughts in her head
Falls asleep then wakes up wishing she was
Dead and disgusted with those who she's trusted
To just be fucked over and left in the dust
So she'll cling to her bottle
And hope that tomorrow she won't sit and wallow again

Built out of the bones that I've been breaking

Is there but you can't see it
You might be down and out but you're still breathing

If you write the story
You'll find out we're all stuck on the same page

'Cause sometimes things will bend you
But trust me you'll be fine
'Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb
And life's not out to get you
Despite the things you've been through
'Cause what you give is what you get
And it doesn't make sense to make do

The walls are caving in again
Happens every now and then
Always got me feeling like I'm fucked (fuck)
Falling in and out of bed sleep so hard
Feel like I'm dead
Trying to get a grip is kinda rough
Say life has lost its meaning
And that's true if you believe it
But someday you will stand above your demons

In the morning I will wake up to a blinding light
And curse at my mistakes
And say I'm not what you think
I'll break all the links
I'll ignore all the exit signs
Cause you've had your own mountains to climb
And I've got skeletons I hide
In the back of my mind where I question myself
I dwell on the past just like everyone else

Don't bear the weight of the world on your shoulders
It's not too heavy
I'll break my back so you can feel like someone's on your side

Forget the past and all the heartache
The growing pains that keep you awake
I'll sing you to sleep
With songs that let you know that we'll be okay
Round and round and round this goes
Playing on your stereo
When I'm away and you can't sleep
Just know that it's the same for me

And every time I see you I remember why I made you mine
That day in mid-December
Still so young and naïve with our hearts on our sleeves
But I know we'll be alright
They don't know what we share in the briefest of moments
I'm head over heels for the smallest components
That light in your eye or that look on your face
Secure in the fact that we both know our place
No one like you girl
No one in the world
The perfect touch to the picture I had in my head
No one like you girl
Nowhere in the world
That I would rather be

Don't bear the weight of the world on your shoulders
It's not too heavy
Since we met it seems like we crossed paths at the right time

The growing pains that keep you awake
I'll sing you to sleep

I’m looking down at this place I hate and at least for a second it seems okay
But I’m not getting over it
Getting used to it
It’s been so long since everything seemed to fit
And it’s not a case of being scared or undeserving
I’m just questioning the purpose of leaving what I thought was pulling me down
But I’ll bite my tongue and grit my teeth
I’ll leave my heart where I leave my home
I never thought that I’d be on my own
I never knew that I had this in me
I kinda think it came all too quickly
But I know that growing up’s a part of growing up
So I guess I’ll just face the facts and throw my bags up on this broken back
I’ll learn from my mistakes and find a place where I can breathe
Somewhere that I can breathe
I’ll miss the smell of the rain on my road
The dirty streets of the town I call home
My friends that kept me from feeling alone
And the broken promises you made that forced me to grow
And I’ll miss the paths I’ve walked a thousand times
The mistakes that I made, the lessons learned from the nights
That I spent with my friends in this town I resent
All ‘cause this is the last of time that I’ll spend around here",https://images.genius.com/6df8c3a4900eff6ce4401d491f9900ef.600x600x1.jpg

Just wish you would think of me
Are you listening?
Ran round in circles 'til after dark
Didn't get very far
Wasn't meant to be
I never thought it would be this hard
It feels like you walked through me
I hope this comes back to haunt you
I hope this comes back to haunt you

Then maybe you would know just how it felt to be like me at my lowest
As you let me out the door, you tore me open
My final words were left unspoken

Told myself that this would be the last time you kept me awake
Some day you'll see, then it's too little too late
I wasn't good enough for you, and then you just stopped trying
What can I say?

I hope this comes back to haunt you
I hope this comes back to haunt you
I hope this comes back to haunt you

Told myself that this would be the last time you kept me awake
Some day you'll see, then you'll be stuck in this place
I wasn't good enough for you, and then you just stopped trying
What can I say?

And everyday that's passing is surely mine to seize
Did every wave that crashed in leave you washed up at her feet?

Hold my hand in the cemetery and you'll be safe
And I know that this is only temporary
And I don't think that it's helping anything

And it's all fun and games until someone gets fucked up
This will end in tears I could never be enough for you
Count my blessings on one hand and my curses on the other
I let you slip between my fingers
Hideaway until the summer

Kali Ma lean over me
Rip your hand into my chest
Pull out my beating heart for the world to see
Then send me down to hell
You ignore my pleas
Indiana couldn't save me
So I guess I'll save myself

We hopped from bench to bench in the middle of our town
Where the streetlights hit your eyes and then the tears came falling down
The love that you confessed, the product of your loneliness
I see right through you but what do I do?

Of course, I fall for it just like I did when I was sixteen
Such a fool for you
Did you ever even miss me? (Doubt it)

And did I fuck up too many times?
Found the bad I know you'd find
And just need some time and space
We've fallen out of place
But I pray to God we don't lose connection
Just need to see you smile or maybe stay awhile
Before we lose all sense of direction

That I'm sorry for the things I do?

Stood shy in your dad's jacket

Spend nights sitting up, wasting away
All the shit that we did when we were younger
Think back and it feels like yesterday
We were losing teeth
Stayed up again last night, talk some sense to me
But so it seems the time has come
To pack your bags, close eyes and run like I did
If you do it first I'll follow straight behind you
Cuz growing old is a waste of time
To say goodbye is a waste of breath
We'll stick it out til the bitter end
I remember every night that we spent on the edge
The cold warmth and the bitter taste that it left
Young, dumb, carefree and reckless
But there's some method to the madness

Passed out in the living room
Moved on but I'll see you soon
Bored now you're absent
Back home there's still nothing to do
Though we complained about it all
Was such a worthwhile waste of my time
Each day and each night a memory
Take care and please don't forget me
Don't give a fuck what they have to say
Cuz we'll just do it anyway
And if I break a bone or it fries my brain
We took a risk and laughed at our mistakes
Give a fuck if we don't fit in!
We don't need them
They don't know a thing about us
All the times we shared
The world at our feet and in the wind in our hair
But some things must change
And as much as I hate it
It kills me to say our goodbyes as we turn the page
And move on to the next chapter
And hope it won't hold disaster
Now the world's so big it seems
But the blank white walls won't let me breathe
And if the big wide world caved in tonight
I'd see you on the other side

Passed out in the living room
Moved on but I'll see you soon
Bored now you're absent

Sat on the kitchen floor all alone talking to a ghost
About where we go when we go
He said, ""Life is the great unknown""
Better jump, better run and…

I need a cleaner frequency
I frequently burn out and vanish
I'm on another planet
There's just no getting through to me
But then I find myself in bed
Lost inside my head again
Running over everything
The voices, they are deafening
Out from the noise
I hear that familiar voice

Better jump, run

I’ll kick the cans aside and dig into my pockets
Walk home another night
And think this one over
All over and over again
I’ll just bide my time
Sink into my thoughts to get away from here
Eight weeks to take that drive
And think this one over
All over and over

Deceptively beautiful

She's in everything you do
Her kiss it tastes so sweet
But left me with a lethargy
I couldn't shake, I made a grave mistake

I gave her my heart, she didn't want it
Took it anyway and put a dark spell on it
Since then I haven't been the same
Needed a victim and she got it
Took me in with her song, powerless to stop it
Some men don't dare to speak her name

She picked me up from my decline
Healed my wounds with love and wine
Dosed me up and closed my eyes
A taste of poison
She gave me all that I desired
Sung the songs of angel choirs
Preached the words of death and fire and left me burning

And the gloom that I felt for a year
And the clouds are always shaped just like you

Lay in the bed that you made
So I can finally say that I'm fine

And unearth all your imperfections

Bled close to death with you all night

If I just play this cool it might pay off for once

Bend the rules until they break
You always knew just how to make me fall to me knees
I felt so sick, ill at ease
But I'm getting better

And I hope that this time you finally see
That you can't get away with everything
I moved on and the world opened up for to me
The thought of you use to make me cave in
Gave you a chance but you threw it all away
The tables turned and there's nothing left to say
Done being a wall you lean against
Just needed some time so I could
Open up my window
Let the air clear out my head
Think how fast the years go and all the things I left unsaid
Another old regret that I'll hide beneath my bed
I guess some distance was the best cure for this
'Cause rest assured it's not you I miss anymore
And I don't care where you lay your head at night

Because with you it's all swings and roundabouts
Gave you a chance but you still wouldn't hear me out
And I hope that it kills you I'm happy now
I hope you hate the taste of your own medicine
Those skeletons buried in my head
And all the thoughts I have of you, make me wish we never met

And I don't care where you lay your head at night
I know I won't miss the smell of you in my room

Drive home and think about the things I said
You never learn from this you just expect
You are my hesitant smile
You are my crippling doubt
You're everything that I hide about myself

Set deep but tainted skin

Accept defeat but curse the cracks up empty streets

To look back over history with nothing but regret.""

Just to hear what I've been missing

If a picture is all that I have
I can picture the times that we won't get back
If I picture it now it don't seem so bad
Either way, I still wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
Either way, I still wish you were here

Thinking back on the days
Where we all used to say
""I know anywhere's better than here""
In the back of the class
Where we grew up too fast
Living life like there's nothing to fear
But the ice on the road
Driving home all alone
Singing along to a song from three summers ago
The one that made you remember it
Now I'll always remember it (I'll always remember it)
As the song that your life ended with

If a picture is all that I have
I can picture the times we won't get back
If I picture it now it don't seem so bad
Either way, I still wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
Either way, I still wish you were here

And they say you're in a better place
But a better place is right here with me
Yeah, they say you're in a better place
Too bad it's not what I believe

'Cause a picture is all that I have
To remind me that you're never coming back
If I picture it now it just makes me sad
And right now I just wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
In the end, I just wish you were here

Yeah they say you're in a better place

It was just a feeling
He was emptying the coffers
While I was staring at the ceiling
Washed up
Or what you wanna call it
Popping the good shit
With the boys at the office
How 'bout it?

On the verge of poverty
And a full blown meltdown
I'm still a loser and always will be
So why change now?

Fucked up
Oh, who cares anyway?
With one foot in the gutter
And the other in the grave, I was thinking
How long will self-destruction be alluring?
It's good for business and baby business is booming
Isn't that a trip?

I'll be sure to write it down
When I hit rock bottom
For all the people who love to fetishize problems
And to tell the truth
I fetishize them too
It's pretty messed up, isn't it?

And make no mistake
I know exactly what I'm doing
I'm just surprised the world isn't sick
Of grown men whining like children
You shouldn't take it so seriously
It's just music after all
And half the crap I say is just
Things I've stolen from the bathroom walls
Of shitty venues across America
And I'm losing interest in self-help
Equally bored of feeling sorry for myself

Since I've had a full blown meltdown

,Sleep in the Heat,The Dream Is Over,2016-05-27,"I was feeling a little bizarre
The day that I buried my family car
In the scrap metal wrecking yard
And I've said so many goodbyes
In the twenty-five years that I've been alive
And I don't know why this one was so hard
And every time when I go back to my apartment
All I wanna do is get stoned
And I'm sick and tired of blacking out on my carpet
And waking up all on my own so I brought you home
You started falling apart
Six months after you moved in
And I should have known from the start
That things would be different
It's not something that I can fix
If I could do anything, you know I would
If this fucking vacation would come to an end
Maybe then you'd be normal again
Last week, when I went back to my apartment
You were looking so stoned
The day after Christmas, you acted so different
You just wanted to be on your own
So I bought you medicine, went to the vet and
Cashed all of my savings and loans
But it was too late, you were letting go
Whoa whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa oh oh oh
And nothing I say will make it okay
You just sleep in the heat and repeat
You're wasting away
And nothing I do is gonna save you
I'm trying my best, but you can't even
Look at me or talk to me or tell me what's happening to you
Yesterday, I went back to my apartment
To see how you've been holding up
You hadn't been eating, I thought you were sleeping, but
You're not waking up
And I want you to know that I'd spend every bit of my
Pitiful savings and loans
Just to see you again

In this desolate fishing town
Counting the months as they wear me down

In the spring they patrol the coast
Fearing the worst
And no one can seem to accept the fact

Where they found the body

Balancing on the sidewalks of this suburban town
Maybe this year I'll be able to stand up on my feet
Or maybe I'll fall again

Don't get me wrong, I wish a lot of things were the way they used to be
The streets that used to make me feel alive just make me feel alone
The holes in the wall get bigger every year

It's hard to think that some people in this world look at me with the same eyes as yours
I've been breaking all ten fingers for you and you wouldn't even lift one up for me
Appreciation's something you lost in the dirt that's on your hands and knees

But I'm never gonna be just a hole in the wall

Before it falls?
Leaving won't fix your problems

You're not the only one

Turns out we're broken and careless

You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on 'cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better

You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
When are you coming back?

Listening to these songs I know you don't like
I've been wondering where you are and who you're with
We used to lay on your kitchen floor at two a.m
I was forty miles away from my house
But I never felt so at home
I was forty miles away from my house

You never called before you left to move west
I was just dead weight pulling you down
I'll move forward without the person I need
When somethings fallen apart as many times as us
I can't put it back together it's not the same

You still run through my head every night
When I lay in bed

You used to cover up the cigarette burn
On the passenger seat of my car
Now there's just empty coffee cups
And long drives by myself",https://images.genius.com/ec0c894018e7facdbf976f05ccebbf55.700x700x1.jpg

And I can still hear those secondhand stories fall off your tongue
It's just not the same around here without you
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets
Don't take in too much too soon
Keep your chin up out there
Don't forget where you came from and who cares about you
Whenever you're missing home, just look at your arm
You've got the state lines inked into your forearm
There's still memories of you pinned on my wall
It's just not the same around here without you
Most of the time I feel like you're in over your head out there
You ran away from the Midwest and traded it in for beaches and east coast sunsets

It's time to start over and move on
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says ""you can't miss what you forget.""
I'll spend the night slamming doors
Smoking outside my grandparents house
I thought Christmas was the time for us to feel loved
I feel like no one understands me anymore
Nothing is how it was last year
But it's cold and lonely, just like before
It's time to start over and move on
My grandma keeps going on about the New Year
She says ""you can't miss what you forget.""
I'll sit and wonder who she loves instead of me
If she told me who it was
I'm afraid it would rip my heart out
For my family to see
At least they'd know I had a heart",https://images.genius.com/da9598024751cf6e576ad9d5e0b9c504.1000x1000x1.jpg

As if I was keeping a secret from you

And I don't know how to swim

You're the type of girl that lets this whole town know
When your lips come anywhere near a bottle
All you want is the attention from every eye and ear
That covers up the walls in this room

I'd rather sleep with just my bony knees
And the thought of someone that stands up straight
I guess I'll sleep alone tonight
You'll tell everyone you're different

I was naive and weak back then
Without much trouble on my shoulders

I won't know how to put myself back together

I took two steps forward but three steps back
Had to take a deep breath before my bags were packed
It's gotta get easier from here
I had to learn to live without looking back
Look inside myself to find the things I lacked
I'm better off without all of your doubt
You don't know me, or who I'll be
And without your help I've grown so much this year
I try to find a way to make you see
The good in me, make you believe
I wasn't ready then but I can show you how
I'm ready now
One thing I've learned is that
Good things will not fall in my lap
I had to work harder and longer
Be smarter and stronger
Than the person right beside me
Have the confidence and common sense
To know there's still something inside me
I gave my very best, with the purest intent

Without a destination

And in life we're gonna cry

There's a reason that I up and left about a week ago
If complaining is your only move
Then it’s all about my whereabouts and what I plan to do

I'll never find your heart in a place like this
I'll never find your trust when it doesn't exist

I wanna start over, where do we begin?
I thought I was stronger than to let you in
I'm finally learning how the tables are turning
So let's start this over, but where do we begin?

Sometimes you can read my mind
It's like we're always breaking ground at the same time
And I noticed you don't show it
With Boston still on your skin
The answer isn't where you are, it's where you've been
And you know it, so control it, cause I figured out

I'll never find your heart in a place like this
This town isn't yours to miss

I wanna start over, where do we begin?
I thought I was stronger than to let you in
I'm finally learning how the tables are turning
So let's start this over, but where do we begin?

Am I strong enough now to keep my feet on the ground?
Can I tell you how I'm feeling with out making a sound?
Am I strong enough now to keep my feet on the ground?
So long, here's your song

I wanna start over, where do we begin?

And no more waiting on a dial tone
Because I’ve loved and lost a cause

Where did you want me to begin?
Take a stand
You know you haven’t got what you came for
And recently, my counter seems to be the place to be at night
You were right, I must be wrong for wanting you to know
I let go
Of the old
And you don’t deserve to see
Where it leads
Me to be

You can see my imperfection
Still, at least I’ll never be ungrateful

Opposite of here there’s a bold faced enemy
But sure enough, when I look up
It’s myself staring back at me
I’m not saying there’s a reason
Close it up and leave it, even though
We’d still be tearing the pages
Before the rest of it changes
So let’s go

I can feel you slipping away
Can we savor every moment
Find ourselves along the way

Oh, you're making me sick, what is this?
Had we been drawn too close before?
Because I dropped my forgiveness
It's lying face-down on the floor

I've got more secrets than you'll ever know
Another year and you won't let it go
Too many times I told myself to hold on
But it's too late for me, now I'm as good as gone

Funny how we go way back and we said that
We wouldn't let this come between
Everything, and is it true that I could look past
Memories and stay obscene?
Oh, your idea of me blown away, away
Something's telling me I never
Could have ruined everything you want in life
Because you never put in the effort, and the truth is
You were never doing it right

Oh, you're making me sick, what is this?
Am I the one you can't ignore?
Because I dropped my forgiveness
It's lying face-down on the floor

I've got more secrets than you'll ever know
Another year and you won't let it go
Too many times I told myself to hold on
But it's too late for me
Now I'm as good as gone

It turns out I don't go down that easily
You'll never really know what this means to me
And no, it wasn't ever too much to hold
But you stole your own self-control
It turns out I don't go down that easily
You'll never really know what this means to me
And no, it wasn't ever too much to hold so just know

I've got more secrets than you'll ever know
Another year and you won't let it go
Too many times I told myself to hold on
But it's too late for me, now I'm as good as gone

Not everybody wants an enemy
Call me the culprit and that's all you'll see
You were responsible for finding a way to catch on

Knew it all too well, never end up stale

Shape up, and stand tall

It compliments the fact that you've got nothing to say
I knew that it took time and a fucked up mind
Just to stay in line
But all the value I could demonstrate
And all the places that I've grown to hate
Well, they bring life, so I'll say it twice
I just wanna know what it's like to rebel

So I'll tell myself that I'm not a victim
But I'll own up to the mistakes that I made

I could lie if you wanted
But in the night I think of all this time and all this space
And all the tracks in the dirt that we could retrace back home
I'm not alone
Don't put my story back on it's shelf
I was choked up but my tongue untied itself

So I'll tell myself that I'm not a victim

Or was it another empty promise

You've left us now, but we're not alone
Before you know it, your cup's overflown

If ever that day never comes it would be too soon, my love

,We’re All to Blame,Chuck,2004-08-31,"(Far in. aohhhh. Wait, we singing?)
Take everything left from me
All! To! Blame!

How can we still succeed taking what we don't need?
Telling lies, alibis, selling all the hate that we breed
Super-size our tragedies (you can't define me, or justify greed)
Bought in the land of the free, (land, free)

And we're all to blame
We've gone too far, from pride to shame
We're trying so hard
We're dying in vain
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
To all we are
We want it all
With no sacrifice!

Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear
Stand to salute, say thanks to the man of the year
How did we all come to this? (you can't define me, or justify greed)
A greed that we just can't resist (resist)

And we're all to blame
We've gone too far, from pride to shame
We're trying so hard
We're dying in vain
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
To all we are
We want it all
Every one wants it all
With no sacrifice!

Tell me now
What have we done
We don't know
I can't allow
What has begun to tear me down, believe me now
We have no choice left with our backs against the wall!

And now
We're all to blame
We've gone too far
From pride to shame
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
When all we need
Is something true to believe
Don't we all
Everyone
Everyone
We will fall

Because we're all to blame
We've gone too far
From pride to shame
We're trying so hard
We're dying in vain
We want it all
Everyone
Don't we all",https://images.genius.com/a63a8168f7716ff87cd37ce672229e35.1000x963x1.jpg

When we're only half of what we used to be today?
Could you see this isn't what we need?
And I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell
So goodbye, farewell

What am I to say? I still remember everyday
And memories don't fade away
And it all falls apart in the shadows of the past

How could you be the better part of me

And I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell

To pull your trigger is now, what you're waiting for?
I stand accused myself, sometimes I'm wrong
God help me and hear beneath my lie, what am I praying for?
I don't believe in hell but I just might be there tonight

I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul

As I bleed my heart out to show and I won't let go

Thoughts ran unspoken, forever and now
And pieces of memories fall to the ground
I know what I didn't have, so I won't let this go
Cause it's true, I am nothing without you

With nowhere to go, have come to an end

Getting high, and trying to figure it out

There was a sacrificial ritual inside my room last night
Was held there in secret, hard to see anything in the candle light
Now there is melted wax all over my floor
And the scent of incense is rising up from underneath the door
Now, maybe it was not as serious as I am making it sound

Just you and me
Getting high, and hanging out
Getting high, and messing around
Getting high, and trying to figure it out

I feel the burn, my tired feet
Not much to go, a few more streets
See, your face is all I need

And you would think I never had it
The way that this world likes my magic
But it was all for you
To continue to be able
To continue to be able

I put my wrong finger in the hot wax
Now I can't play for you like that
The last thing I need is truly
The stupid excuse for a reason to fight back
I can't begin
Begin to tell you
The way it all felt
When everything fell through

You moved to New York to meet a beautiful girl
And drink fancy cocktails without a care in the world
But you got scared they're all gonna find someone else
So you find one and tell it things you're dying to tell
We got high as hell, (the record) I forget how it went
It was a song about love and at the time, it made sense
When the side ended, we just laid there in bed
You had fallen asleep, but I stayed up and read
I made a list of everything I said I never meant
Considered all the things I never said, but I digress
I got dressed, kissed your forehead, and left
You called me when you woke, but I was sleeping off the meds",https://images.rapgenius.com/66a443a71e6d4ae3caea5bfe4f13784c.599x336x1.png

,Pale Beneath the Tan (Squeeze),I Hate My Friends,,"Squeeze! Squeeze! Squeeze! Squeeze!
Squeeze my arms a little tighter
Let me know I'm still alive
'Cause you're the only one here keeping
Both my eyes open tonight
And I know that we've got problems
Who are they to criticize?
If I tell you all my secrets
Would you tell me all your lies?
And when I stop writing her letters
I want her to know that it's because
I met someone that makes me feel
The same exact way that she does
And I will not deny the privilege
To someone else who wants my love
I have stitched a mask of confidence
And I wear it like a glove
And a man who knows what he's talking
Spoke to me today
He said that no one’s going to listen
’Til you mean every word you say
So if you can't find the feeling
You better learn to lie
And if you know we’re gonna fail
Then there’s no point to even try
No point to try
No point to try
No point to try
No point to try
I don't get it, for real
This is blowing my mind
We keep saying we're unhappy
And they keep saying that we're fine
I guess pain will be the only thing
I ever get to bring
But I will send it through the air
Like a loosely-gripped baseball bat swing
All I ever wanted was something different
Maybe by another name
We could set ourselves on fire
There is cleansing in the flame
So keep clapping and dancing
Let them know you're still alive
And if you’re tired of giving up
At least make them think that you survived
So keep laughing, it’s not funny
But at least you don’t have to cry
When you wake up in the morning
And you know you’re still alive
You’re still alive
You know you’re still alive (you’re still alive)
You know you’re still alive (you’re still alive)
You know you’re still alive

’Til we shut down
Until the weight of our lifeless bodies hit the ground
Until we break down

Until the weight of our lifeless bodies hit the ground

,Twin Size Mattress,Talon of the Hawk,2013-05-21,"This is for the lions living in the wiry broke down frames of my friends’ bodies
When the floodwater comes, it ain’t gonna be clear, it’s gonna look like mud
But I will help you swim, I will help you swim, I’m gonna help you swim
This is for the snakes and the people they bite
For the friends I’ve made, for the sleepless nights
For the warning signs I’ve completely ignored
There’s an amount to take, reasons to take more
It’s no big surprise you turned out this way
When they closed their eyes and prayed you would change
And they cut your hair, and sent you away
You stopped by my house the night you escaped
With tears in my eyes, I begged you to stay
You said “Hey man, I love you, but no fucking way”
I’m sure that we could find something for you to do on stage
Maybe shake a tambourine, or when I sing, you sing harmonies
This is for the lake that me and my friends swim in
Naked and dumb on a drunken night
And it should've felt good, but I could hear the Jaws theme song
On repeat in the back of my mind
Make sure you kiss your knuckles before you punch me in the face
There are lessons to be learned
Consequences for all the stupid things I say
And it is no big surprise you turned out this way
The spark in your eyes, the look on your face, I will not be brave
I’m sure we could find something for you to do on stage
Maybe shake a tambourine, or when I sing, you sing harmonies
I wanna contribute to the chaos
I don’t wanna watch and then complain
‘Cause I am through finding blame
That is a decision that I have made
She hopes I’m cursed forever
To sleep on a twin size mattress
In somebody’s attic or basement my whole life
Never graduating up in size to add another
And my nightmares will have nightmares every night
Oh, every night, every night",https://images.genius.com/43d83f340c69f32a58bc15ba5df096dc.1000x1000x1.jpg

To etch behind my eyelids
Like getting stoned when we wake up

Your silhouette in high top sneakers
And hardcore from laptop speakers
The classics to the more obscure
From Minor Threat to your old roommate's band

Like a kaleidoscope in vibrant hues
I navigate around your tattoos
Said you got that one on a whim
When you were breaking up with him
And that Matryoshka Russian doll
That lines your shelf from big to small
What a way to start anew
To shed your skin and find the old you

Everybody wants to get famous
But you just want to dance in a basement
You don't care if anyone is watching
Just as long as you stay in motion
We put miles on these old jean jackets
Got caught up in the drunk conversations
But after the party, it's me and you
After the party, it's me and you

With a new outlook on everything we see
From high upon this rooftop over South Philly
To the nights we lose our self-control
From the sex, from the drugs, from the rock and roll

Before I shipwreck, before I'm 40

What kind of monsters did our parents vote for?

Oh, how’d his words confuse themselves?
With cranks for Christians in powerful positions

I was always hanging out with the older kids
Always in a rush, but I was never sure from what
I was always hanging out with the older kids

The grief starts when bumping into friends turned acquaintances
We stumble around the small talk
We break the silence with Jameson
But once we were inseparable
We were the only punks in town
We spent every weekend raisin’ hell in the basement of your parents house
But we’re older now

Farewell youth, I’m afraid I hardly got to know you
I was always hanging out with the older kids
Always in a rush, but I was never sure from what
I was always hanging out with the older kids

In someone's apartment, getting fucked up
To all our favorite records, drinking the cheap stuff
We couldn’t get enough of growing up
I saw my childhood flash before me in the death of your closed eyes
At your Irish wake we celebrate by trying not to cry

Had it all, took the fall

Specialist Jeg, a much more honest man than you
Came back from the desert where he never found the truth
Now he screeches tires, fills his head with alcohol
While the morbid brown faces hang like portraits on the wall

Had it all, they took it all

Something happened on the way to hell
The new guard, they took my sister
Something happened on the way to hell
The old guard, they took my brother away
Something happened on the way to hell
The same greed, it took our parents
Something happened on the way to hell
The west wall, it took us with it

McTiernan was a good ol' boy, he cheated and he skimmed
""A favor for a favor, it can't be called a sin""
Some may see it different, and some don't see at all
When the papers started calling, he closed his eyes and took the fall

Had it all, took the fall
Had it all, took the fall

Now we're standing on the ledge and we're looking at the ground
I feel my body breaking on the asphalt, hear the sound
Red and blue lights screaming saying step up off that ledge
So we wrap our hearts up in our heads and take the fall instead

,Gates,On the Impossible Past,2012-02-20,"I am the pain that beats through your temples
Every morning when you wake up
I am the boy with alcohol poisoning
From all the parties Chris was throwing
That summer that they took us in
Like every other American
For getting drunk round the back of the Lions' Club
Waiting for the shitty bands to finish up
And some kids played hacky sack while the others just got high

It's not hard to fall for a waitress
When you both smoke, smoke the same cigarettes
You'll get seated as diner's lovers
She'll get the check as friends for the better
You'll carve your names into the Paupack cliffs
Just to read them when you get old enough to know
That happiness is just a moment

So, I'm marching up to your gates today
To throw my lonely soul away
'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back
So, I'm marching up to your gates today
To throw my lonely soul away
'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back

And they will make examples out of us
Like when they caught you in the CVS parking lot
But I fed the liars, I fed the liars
I fed the liars everything I got, everything I got
In my cabinet brain of canned thought
It was everything I got, oh everything I got
In my cabinet brain, in my cabinet brain

So, I'm marching up to your gates today
To throw my lonely soul away
'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back

Her playful prose followed me for days
Down the alleyways of my desire

And a thousand years may come and go
We may never meet another soul
Here on our own island of Elba in the Poconos
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

And we bathed in the sun
Cut our jeans into shorts
Outstared every star in the sky
Under the cover of nowhere the present was a present
It looked beautiful on you every night

But we knew it would end yeah we knew it all along
It was a future never reconciled
It’s as if letting your shackled heart feel loved was more difficult than total denial

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile

And a thousand years may come and go
I may never meet another soul
Here on my own island of Elba in the Poconos

She’d only reappear every now and again
I’d smile at the thought of us
Go back to my day
But that was purely wishful thinking

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

And a thousand years may come and go
I may never meet another soul
Here on my own island of Elba in the Poconos

And though we’re guilty of nothing we feel like fugitives running
Towards the Great White North or a border town in Mexico

There's former you, there's former me

We moved to different corners of the country
Now we come back for holidays and funerals
So much has changed but Wayne County’s still the same

Drivin’ down 191
There's an old memory of someone
As a little white cross just popping out from the bend

In a search for what's now lost forever

When  the celebrations come to an end
When  the party's over, Sunday morning wakes up sober
Begs for me to start up again
I’m whiskey drunk in the Shop Rite parking lot
I’m  waiting while Anna buys milk and eggs
Sometimes  I wonder why she hasn’t found another
One that her girlfriends would recommend

Our  worst fights are when we get silent
Just a disappointed you shaking your head
When the cards and flowers don’t work
I sleep on the couch when I’m a jerk
What's  gotta give, what's gotta give

‘Cause I know what you’re thinking
That I can’t stop drinking
Every time you try and ask me to
I just throw a fit and storm out of the room
‘Cause I know what you’re thinking

I’m cheap beer drunk in a bar off Passyunk
I’ll be here until the lights come up again
Feel free to join me if you’re bored or feeling lonely
I could sure use the company
I miss you so much when I was your drunk lush
You knew me so well, I knew you half as well
Love’s a cruel, cruel joke when the tools in the shed can’t fix what’s broke
So you leave it broke

And I've been wandering nightly
Through the garden of your heartache
Always making a mess, always stumbling out the door
But, I don't wanna be an asshole anymore

Baby, baby I'll be good to you
I don't wanna be an asshole anymore
Baby, baby, I'll be good to you
Baby, baby, I'll be good to you

Another night, I devoured the sun
And plunged myself into the depths of oblivion
Yeah somewhere along the way I found wine
Feels damn good just to bleed sometimes
But all I ever wanted was to make things right
The years of idleness and spite
I push my emotions off a bridge
After taking them hostage with a shotgun
Now they're somewhere treading water
Somewhere lost inside the man that I'm not
But I don't wanna be an asshole anymore

Baby, baby I'll be good to you
I don't wanna be an asshole anymore
Baby, baby, I'll be good to you
I'll be good to you, I'll be good, I'll be good, I'll be good

I won't lie no more about where I've been
And I won't pry no more
Over the people that you're hanging with
You're the only lover that I ever missed
Ever been hopelessly in love with
Look at this tangle of thorns

From the state of Massachusetts
Tucked in the back of my wallet
I'll cash it when I'm back in Boston
With a blank eye from the cashier
For why it's torn and busted up

I remember that moment of silence
I was at a mall in Norwich
Shoppers stared at the ground
The escalators went on smoke breaks
Oh 1918, you've yet to see the worst of humans acting

Maybe the future's just a little bit weird
Maybe the God you love is all I've got to fear
Life's a terminal illness in remission
So I took the weight of it all out for a drink
And then we drove back, drunk
Through the busy city streets

I hate how I always get nervous
Every time I try to speak
In front of a big crowd
A pretty girl, or the police
And I hate the things that I know about you
And all the horrible things that you do

I don't want to be late for war today
I want to chew up my dinner and spit in your face
Light fire to your home and tap your cell phone

Somewhere in the overgrowth of your memory
And at night you wander through
As the image of a former you
Searching every nook and every cranny
For the form that I'm taking

But baby, baby I'm right here!
I try to shout and scream and say
But my darling you just swat
You just swat me away
And in my greatest desperation
I dig deep into your skin
A little itch to keep the thought of me

But nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good

I'm at the party in a cloud of nicotine
Exhaled by drunk twentysomethings
There's a couple arguing in the bathroom
A couple kids just trying to get high
I try to make my way outside
'Cause I've got to see you tonight
I start pacing then running

""But baby, baby buzz me in!""
I ring your intercom and say
But you just poke your head through the curtain
And my heart's on the floor

But nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good

Like the dead cat in the alley
Like the garbage overturned
Like the uninviting orgy
On top of some dog shit in the yard

A little rewind to a simpler time
I swear it’s temporary living in this cheap motel
Somewhere in the bible belt
We made love at that Marietta Motel 6
You fell asleep on my shoulder of commitment
Took it as a sign everything would be fine
Sometimes it takes these kind of nights just to realize
How we want to spend the rest of our lives

Will you get your shit together?
When are you gonna marry her?
Well maybe you don’t deserve her
Maybe the whole thing was doomed from the start

Exiled to an island of plastic
Waiting on translation, the fool's coronation

Whispers in the shadows

Building castles of cans and bottles
Drinking like they do in novels
Know they'll catch me by and by

Faded stars in the air that we breathe
In the earth, in the sea

I fell in love before the morning arrived
She wore a blue dress to combat the heat
Drank beer from a bottle and danced in the street
Then I heard her singing something fairly familiar
A tale of two lovers in the thick of the summer
There in the moment, we kissed in the hammock
We argued over which Bad Religion album was better
Well, I thought ‘No Control’ or ‘Suffer’
And then she became queen of the neighborhood parties
'Cause I was an unknown boy along for the ride
Kept the guitar right by my side
It was better than conversing with the kids I didn’t like
But on the fourth of July, when the fireworks rang out
She met a new boy who was more hip and less strung out
I drove home with fire in the sky
Fiddled with the dials and stumbled across something
That you were always humming
As time tables suggest
We were only just friends
In constant motions, covering stilts
I’ll give you a dollar for another ride home
Or something to mix with your Coke
Well maybe if you want to wander around outside tonight
Meet me in Lake Ariel after midnight
Or really whenever, I only want to talk
I only want to relive what was lost

Penned on a treaty that kept our armies at rest

The sands of time in an hourglass
That you're always begging for back

The good times we can't repeat
Those days are gone and we can never get them back
Now we must move ahead
Despite our fear and dread
We're all just wishing we could stop, but

And sets another stage

About her feet all up in the air

And I don't need to hear about how long it was taking
Or how the walls, they were shaking

Now lying in bed, wallowing in sorrow
Missing the tomorrow that we could have had
Running through my head, over and over
Things I never told her now just make me sad
And it drives me insane, sitting with the vision
Stuck with that image burned into my brain
And I feel so dumb that I could ever trust her
While someone else fucked her, then walked away

And I don't really wanna to know

I’m the book you always opened but you never read
(Never read)
Beside the box you call your bed
(Beside the box you call your bed)

It’s your fault I’d say
I let this blind me
Forlorn in sullen head
Suffer your ill intent

Watch your mind ignore
Just like all those times before
That’s the way it is
And I won’t write you back anymore
There’s better faces
To fill all the spaces
Left by the masks you wore


Maybe that’s the reason I was never enough (never enough)
Cause all I do is chalk it up to bad luck (bad luck)

State all the premises figuring you’ll be just fine
So I’ll get mine you get yours and if we’re both happy it's settled forevermore
Holding the impression of a man when I was still a boy
Said no regrets but it's hard not to feel any remorse
I’m still debating whether I have even found the source
Of all my discomfort and blunt discourse
But I know what I want and don’t need what I get
I invest my ideas but get swallowed in debt
And the only release is to yell and to sweat
Until my clothes are soaking wet
Stay under my skin
Tear me limb from limb
Plague me to an end
I can’t believe I always thought I would be there for you
For now I’ll learn and settle for less
Shut my eyes and get some rest
Feel the pulse beneath this sunken chest
And maybe one day I can be there for you
Isn’t it true that if it hadn’t been for me you’d still have no place safe to fall
And all this time I thought I knew
When I had no idea at all
All is fair in love and war
You have your gifts some say they're poor
But I don’t care about any of that anymore
Let us depart and return when we have grown some more
I wish I could say that I’ve seen this before
The depth of the bottom the taste of the floor
It leaves me restless and tired and sore
But you won’t break my mind just yet
I battle this alone
I don’t want to push you
I just want to grieve

Take another pull to make certain you forget
And to think that you're somebody's daughter
Away at college not getting smarter
Everything changes when all the lights in the room are as low as you
But don't trip you'll sober up soon
Regain an honest perspective as you puke on the floor

As a ghost who would haunt this mountain
And all this time I thought that I’d stay
Alive in the ground digging out my coffin
Time was short on courts and pavement
We knew we had to leave
But did I make the most of every day
And did I give to not receive?
Are there any better words to express the full extent of my grief?
It hits home when you’re not home
There’s no space to grow
And all this time not much to show
And all this time I thought that I'd stay

And do my best to live with the stress that's mounting

I understand we all went away so we could have the stories to share when we’re back
Try to pass the same old shit to get ahead and start your paper stack

Where I’m the dormant one and you’re away

The framework’s laid

And writing just to erase this

My walls are built up high, forever bound to be steep
I've got a birds' eye view of all the secrets you keep

Try to tell me that you knew from the start
That I would come to know that most would never enter my heart
Because I'm colder than the others, it's what sets me apart

I've been away for so long
All I’ve got are weak foundations, wishful thoughts
And all around a greater view

How do you think that that’s okay?

To still try not to walk my way?
I taught you all those things I say
It's nothing like it used to be
There’s no more of what I used to see
But you help me with my honesty
While I’m yelling at your ghost

Make things worse, I always seem to make things worse
Cause I can't seem to shake this curse
I can't seem to put you first
And I spend all my time with you in my hindsight
Got so many questions that I'll ask when the times right

And think about who you let between your thighs?

It all depends on where I am and who I’m there with
It’s rough when we’re both square one
With so much undone
Who lost, who won?
All rain, no sun
Don’t want to have to speak to anyone

Said this will kill if you let it somehow I forget
I should be asleep I shouldn’t be upset
Playing the victim while you’re still here
Blaming the future on things I fear
I keep blaming the future on things I fear

Waking up to gloom and routine again
You’re breathing in
That air that dries your lungs
But you kept our trust
And said do what you must to be happy
And I left with a debt that called me out
Quick to be honest with it all
So now I just sing (I just sing)
About missing this and missing that
But what will it really bring?
If we’re both square one
With so much undone
Who lost, who won?
All rain


Just a special circumstance
Where in lies the worst part I can’t accept
Coming up on Fall
Are there things we haven’t spoke on yet?

Sleeping off the restlessness
Everything will be fine
Just gotta keep my mind on your bed and your bed on my mind
I’m so sore from sleeping on the floor
I never see your face anymore
(Maybe I’ll come back around)
I’m so sore from sleeping on the floor
I want what we had before
(You made me come back)

Stifled there but you still walk in place
I’m distant now they say I’m rude of late
I pass up that sleep as my mind debates
The message I put forth just admit if you’re not sure

All they’ll know is second best
But it still brings the restlessness
Don’t think that it’s fine
I lie because this distance is poison
It fucks with my mind
I’m so sore, can you give me some more
Space to grow what was sewn before
(You made me come back around)
I’m so sore, stomach’s on the floor
I swear I always wake up before
(You made me come back)

Can’t help but dwell on what you’re doing
I’m much too slow for the pace that you’re moving
A piece of us will stay unmoving
But how’s it ever going to feel the same again?

Stifled there but you still walk in place

Still doesn't mean that I'm not in your head
I'm falling in and out again
Slipped up and cared too much again
I must wake up, move on and mend
Instead of wasting so much time here
Cause I've grown up only to hate my own bed
I figure I'll just sleep when I'm dead
Despite what you heard I know what I said
I understand it was harsh but guess what?
I'm falling in and out again

Put yourself in my place for just one day
Watch all the colors in your spectrum fade grey
More aware than ever that I might never be calm again
And it shakes every fucking bone
Trying to do the right thing on my own
So I let the ink tell you how
I come to grips with all of this

I'm getting too old for this

What do you know, my shoes are my own
Tread the granite till you find
Some kind of place to call home

More aware than ever that I might never be calm again
And it shakes every fucking bone
Trying to do the right thing on my own

Told me that you had to leave

Your glare is the faintest, no brightness to show
I made the best of what I thought was impossible
You were the spade I used to dig this hole
Blistered my skin to the bone

Swear all the pain's done, no trace or tremor here
Or am I still numb? Have I been this whole year?
So let me bite down, feel the clench in my teeth
'Til I come around, then relapse and repeat

Swear I never meant to haunt
All I ever do is taunt
Couldn’t handle how you flaunt

Has been for so many months
Now it’s wild to remember I was in love with you once

It's all love now, upside down
It's all love now, upside down

I lose us in a bad undertow
Have to channel how you made me feel
To play every show
Make my snide suggestions about
The things I don’t know
I will not catch a feeling I’ll just float
All that time across the pond
All this resin in my lungs
No more room to shoulder on
Am I even having fun?

Scott is looking for the one
Mertz is going by Ryan now that we’ve all had our run

It's been three years since I'm knocking on your door
And I still can knock some more
Oh girl, oh girl, is it feasible?
I wanna know now, for I to knock some more
You see, in life I know there's lots of grief
But your love is my relief
Tears in my eyes burn, tears in my eyes burn

Cause these are days when everyone's as miserable as him
Josh says it smells like cheap beer and loathing here
It could be the van, but it's probably just his breath
Max dropped out of college
But he likes to say he finished
He's working back home with his dad
He and Kevin got matching tattoo's of their initials
And three X's down their legs
Well I've got like-minded dudes in Detroit or Vancouver
Newport, Boca and Brum
I don't know where I am
But I know where I came from
So everyone moved in with their girlfriends
(In one-bedroom apartments)
In the town that we grew up in and
All my friends are in bar bands
I don't know how it happened
I hope it pays the rent
And still there's some days
When I don't think that we'll ever see Dave again
Justin's working three jobs just to stay ahead
Spiro lied about his major
But it's working out for him
Nick and Richie got a place together by the train station
I've spent twenty-two years just wading through bullshit and hey
It's worked so far

,And Now I’m Nothing,Suburbia I’ve Given You All and Now I’m Nothing,2011-06-14,"I can't help myself
I keep ending up in Memorial Park
Breaking finger nails while I claw at the frozen ground
Because as long as I'm home
I can dig up these bones
There's no point to just letting go
And as long as you've known me I've been backing out slowly
I won't end up underneath the snow, the snow
This is where it's been
The manger scene every Christmas
Next to the cannon
Every year someone steals baby Jesus
Nobody stops them
It's a nice tradition
I'll put my life back together in silence
While writing songs on Molly's guitar
And Suburbia, stop pushing
I know what I'm doing
So I moved myself and two boxes of things
To the basement room at Richie's house
And I'm happy here for now
Because I've been in search of some steadier footing
Or just a place to call home
I know that I'm introspective when broken
But I've been spending most of my nights here alone
And that doesn't scare me like it did a year ago
I'll put my life back together in silence
While writing songs on Molly's guitar
And Suburbia, stop pushing
I know what I'm doing
Suburbia, stop pushing
I know what I'm doing
Suburbia, stop pushing
I know what I'm doing
I had dreams of myself
As the Allen Ginsberg of this generation
But without the talent, madness or vision
I guess it's looking hopeless
We're a city left digging out cars in unison
And humming like we've healed
I know we've got miles to go
But I'm putting my shoulder to the wheel",https://images.genius.com/2a375af89f78514714d3d6fe3482abfa.1000x1000x1.jpg

Gonna shoot these clouds full of holes
I need some fucking light to pour through
Cause December's got me up against the ropes
And I don't know how to get loose
I can't get feeling back in my toes
From walking in circles with you
Like we're lost Canadian geese
I should be south of here already

I'll be your dead bird, you'll be my bloodhound
You're just doing what you're told
Pick my body off the ground
I'll be your dead bird...

I'm staring at Hemingway's shotgun
And I'll picture him drinking alone
He's forgetting things that he wouldn't have before
His eyes are starting to go
And I heard all about how his plane went down
After Christmas in the Congo
Read about his own death in the paper
I bet it was freeing to know
When you destroy everything worth chasing
There's no where left to go

I'll be your dead bird, you'll be my bloodhound
You're just doing what you're told
Pick my body off the ground
I'll be your dead bird
Hanging from your mouth
You're doing like you're told
Gonna make your master proud
It's good to know
I didn't die for nothing

December’s got me backed into a corner again
My ears are back, my teeth are showing
I'm combing through the wreckage trying to find where I've been
I still get phantom pains but from a safer distance

I'll be your dead bird, you'll be my bloodhound
You're just doing what you're told
Pick my body off the ground
I'll be your dead bird
Hanging from your mouth
You're doing like you're told
Gonna make your master proud

And I keep having dreams
Where I go through the windshield but I don't fix it
Patsy Cline came and sang to me
She told everybody
How she knew she would die soon before she did
I hear her cry on ""Faded Love""
The air in August here's heavy with salt and smoke and stings my lungs
My airbag light's been on for weeks
And I can feel it mock me
It's bittersweet like laughter through crooked teeth
I want to move so far from everything
That they could hear my heart beat
And then break as I lay dying in the street
They'll think the ice cracked at the lake
They'll think a tire blew out and a car crashed on the interstate

It's hard to watch you walk away
These aren't the vultures that were circling just yesterday
It's hard to watch you walk away
(It's hard to watch you walk away)
Picking at bones, at what's left of your misery
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
So when my vocal chords rip
So when my knees give in
So when I bury all of this
Who's gonna give a shit
If I'm breathing?

These aren't vultures that were circling just yesterday
It's hard to watch you walk away

I guess you'd call this regression
I left a real job and a girlfriend
I convinced myself that I'm brave enough for all of this
Well, I spent this whole year in airports
And the floor feels like home
Oh, at least we're never alone
I lost track of the time zones and I'd call but you know

I'm running on empty
The late nights and the long drives start to get to me
I'm just so tired

I spent this year as a ghost and I'm not sure what I'm looking for
I'm a voice on a phone that you rarely answer anymore
I came in here alone
Came in here alone
(But that doesn't scare me like it did seven months ago)
I spent this year as a ghost and I'm not sure where home is anymore

Been on a steady fast food diet
Like we're this generation's Morgan Spurlock
But we don't admit defeat
My body feels rejected and I can't say that I blame it
My heart keeps saying stay young
My lower back seems to disagree
I unrolled a cheap cotton blanket on an old dirty couch
I felt the year start to wind down
I can't stand any dead space
Empty beds bum me out

I spent this year as a ghost and I'm not sure what I'm looking for
I'm a voice on a phone that you rarely answer anymore
I came in here alone
Came in here alone

American broken promises
Caught between the lies you've been fed
And a war with your bloodstream
I should have been there when you needed a friend
I was off on my own again
Selfish and stupid

So if you call me back or let me in
I swear I'll never let you down again
I know the devil you've been fighting with
I swear I'll never let you down again

I had that nightmare again
You're seven and helpless, angry as hell
And you balled up your fists but I laughed at your swings
And I beat you half-conscious
I know that I failed you, woke up in a sweat
I want those years back

So if you call me back or let me in
I swear I'll never let you down again
I know the devil you've been fighting with

And the pastor's words come pouring down like rain
How he called you a sinner and said now you walk with Jesus
So the drugs that took your life aren't gonna cause you any pain
I don't think he even knew your name
And I refuse to kneel and pray
I won't remember you that way
I lit you a candle in every cathedral across Europe
And I hope you know you're still my patron saint
I tried to forgive, but I can't forget the cigar in his fist
I know that they were heartsick, but I need someone to blame
And I know how they blamed me
I know what you'd say
You'd tell me it was your fault
I should put all my arrows away
I'm sure there ain't a heaven
But that don't mean I don't like to picture you there
I'll bet you're bumming cigarettes off saints
And I'm sure you're still singing
But I'll bet that you're still just a bit out of key
That crooked smile pushing words across your teeth
Cause you were heat lightning
Yeah, you were a storm that never rolled in
You were the northern lights in a southern town
A caustic fleeting thing
I'll bury your memories in the garden
And watch them grow with the flowers in spring
I'll keep you with me
These wolves in their suits and ties
Saying, ""Kid, you can trust me""
Charming southern drawl, sunken eyes
Buying good will in hotel lobbies
Buy fistfuls of pills to make sure you don't hurt no more
You don't gotta feel anything
Got their fangs in our veins
Got their voice in our head
Got our arms in their grips
No, we can't shake free
This goddamn machine, hungry and heartless
My whole generation got lost in the margin
We put our faith in you and you turned a profit
Now we're drowning here under the waves

Drowning out under the waves
(We're no saviors if we can't save our brothers)
Drowning out, drowning out

Talking about how the year went

Patty knew my drink
And she asks where the hell we've been?
You used to come here every night
It's not the same without you kids
I cut my hand on a piece of glass
The time we found Dave half dead in the parking lot
Spent the rest of the night in the ER
I cut my hand on a piece of glass
And I hope the scar lasts
So I don't forget that
There's been a table for me there
Through coffee eyes and blank stares
Our late night affairs
There's always been a table for me there
So you can try to forget or say it's the past
You know you'll always end up right back where you left
I ended up here late at night on Thanksgiving
The fall that Colleen left
This was the place to call home
When it felt like the world didn't want us
I watched Mike slash Mon's tires
We laughed about it later
I watched friendships dissolve
In the booth on the back wall
I cut my hand on a piece of glass
And I hope the scar lasts

No good can come from this

I'm letting go
I've been hanging on like poison ivy
Out of cold suburban concrete
From this careless urban sprawl
I'm letting go
You know we can't keep out of trouble
I thought my kids would call you uncle
I thought we'd never be alone

Well I got images
Of you inside my head
Outside of the gas station where we always used to shoplift
It's car-crash rhetoric
We fucked up everything we came in contact with
Just boyhood recklessness

I'm letting go
I've been hanging on like poison ivy
Out of cold suburban concrete
From this careless urban sprawl
I'm letting go
You know we can't keep out of trouble
I thought my kids would call you uncle
I thought we'd never be alone

If you walked me home
Then you'd know how weak my arms got
I just can't carry you
If you walked me home
Well, I know that I'd have flashbacks
Of snow angels and gut laughs
If you walked me home
But you won't, you're all alone
On some bullshit, pill-bottle vision quest
If you walked me home
Well, I don't know when I would finally
Work up the backbone
To walk alone

I’m letting go
'Cause I loved you
But I have to
I'm letting go
You know we can't keep out of trouble
I thought my kids would call you uncle
I thought we'd never be alone
I’m letting go

I hope they let me in

They're standing at attention
An army on your windowsill
We're all waiting for good news
Hoping you can come home soon

But the truth is, I've been losing ground
To a hospital too crowded
A summer winding down

I hadn't felt a heartbreak until now

I grew up on your back porch
And I watched the storms light up the clouds
They hung like paper lanterns
To guide the way back toward your house
I've been putting off long flights
Hoping that you'll be all right
And I'll be there in the meantime

And tried to hide the fact that I was crying
Came in on the red eye

But maybe that was me
I couldn't help thinking of watching the Sears Tower collapse as a kid

And put all my shit in boxes
It's 8 AM so I'm glad I wasn't out late
And I woke up today
Guess it's good I hadn't finished
Unpacking all of this in the first place


Suburbs have abandoned me
I've had the same best friend since '93
I call he's not answering (no)
I can't get comfortable on my own street
I'm not fond of South Philly
Or how my neighbors love ICP
I guess it's better than Bancroft Street
At least the fridge here works and the walls don't leak,
At least I'm starting to see
What's left for me
I'm starting to

We moved on again, so
I packed my shit and left home
It's alright to think I still belong to something I don't
'Cuz I could see why you'd think so

Nothing made me feel further away
Than Left and Leaving through a blown car stereo
Nothing made me feel closer to home
Than Ready to Die through my headphones
So we reached the coast
Where do we sleep tonight?
Damned if I know
We'll try to stay in the airport
Can't send us home and we got no place to go

'Cuz I could see why you'd think so
Don't say it's up to me 
Don't say
Don't say
 (""Don't say"" underlying throughout)
The creaks in the floorboards are calling out to me
I'm laying here again
With my head on my backpack
Wrapped in my hoodie
This is how it is when
Don't say it's up to me
Don't say

I stacked Lonelier than God
Next to You Get So Alone Sometimes
I know how this must look from the outside
It took almost thirteen months
For me to be where I feel fine

,Flowers Where Your Face Should Be,Sister Cities,2018-04-06,"Bright blue hydrangeas
Lost in the weeds
Bus stops and barbed wire on the way to stare
At the heart of the earth from the Poas peak
Just like the ones that we grew back in Jersey
Hung upside down, drying out for the wedding

There's a man with his head in his hands on the sidewalk
His wife's there behind him just off of the street
She scratches his back as he sobs on the asphalt
And what strikes me most is the symmetry
How they're framed just like you and me
When the light from the hospital's eastern wing
Tangles up in your hair and the sadness that pooled in my heart
Starts emptying slowly

Well I saw you last night in my dream
And there were hydrangeas where your face should be

The redwoods feel lonely and lunar and distant
The sun comes in fragments through breaks in the trees
And I feel further from home than I've ever been
These thin lines of light across space tether you to me
They pull in my memories, back to our apartment on 2nd Street
Through the South-facing window the light catches lengths of your hair
Like a path that you left me

Well I saw you last night in my dream
But there were azaleas where your face should be

Pieces of us in the morning sun
Sleeping bags under the 101
She takes off his glasses as he falls asleep again
They don't got much but goddamn they got love

Well I saw you last night in my dream
I'm gonna marry you underneath driftwood from Crescent City",https://images.genius.com/7eaeb31e6a9b8c1663db0e7ae751e26e.600x600x1.jpg
,Heaven’s Gate (Sad & Sober),Sister Cities,2018-04-06,"I've been thinking a lot about
How when the furnace goes
It's the absence of heat that hurts more than the cold
And I got caught in the irony of walking alone
Down an entire block that's just funeral homes
And the ground below

Sad and sober, Sunday afternoon
Sad and sober, Sunday afternoon
You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon
Sad and sober, Sunday afternoon
You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon

I watched parts of you dissolve
Turn to ash and then get carried up
I watched your memory fade
Shadows burned into the wall
And no, I felt my lungs turn into atom bombs
Choke on the Florida heat until the oxygen's gone

Sad and sober, Sunday afternoon
You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon
Sad and sober, Sunday afternoon
You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon

Or an empty room
Or the twelve-bar blues
Or a light in June

You were a bandit, and I was a car wreck
You were the decades on my feet
I was under purple blankets
You were a bandit, and I was a car wreck
You were the rifle on the wall
And it was always gonna end
You were a bandit, and I was a car wreck
You were the false rain that falls
From a window AC unit

And I've been frequenting a diner on Main Street
Where the waitresses are girls that graduated with me
Have problems with oxy, and can't recall what I had to drink
No one knows where they're going
They just know they want out of here badly
Like cigarettes dropped on a highway
They smash, and scatter, and burn out
Somewhere else without knowing

I've got my grandmother's veins in the back of my hands
And just a hint of a South Philly accent
I was born here
(I'll probably die here)
Let's go home

This town's got lies to tell
I'll wait around to hear you out
But I can't keep from digging up these bones forever
At least for now, I'll settle down
I'll try to find some solid ground
I lost my footing trying to get home last winter

The kids in the graduating class
Have got their eyes set west
And California on their lips
But I left some blood there, that I'm never getting back
Rocky's in the Deep South, I don't think he's coming back now
It's sinister, but it's how life worked out

I've got my grandmother's veins in the back of my hands
And just a hint of a South Philly accent

Growing up means
Watching my heroes turn human in front of me
And the songs we wrote at eighteen
Seem shortsighted and naive
So when the weather breaks
I'll pull my hoodie up over my face
I won't run away, run away
'Cause as fucked as this place got, it made me me

This town's got lies to tell
I'll wait around to hear you out

And you rounded out my edges
I'll feel better when the headaches go away
I've got a scar across my forehead
Turning purple in the cold
From a night at Shore Memorial
I was sixteen and afraid
Turned away
Like I'm working babyface
Out of Mid-South in the eighties
I kept a blade hidden in my wrist tape

I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight 'til my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
I think enough is enough
Hidden in the tall grass
In the naked light of day
Put my past self in the ground
I've been dancing on the grave
I'm not the person that I was then
I'm tearing him away
I was bitter, I was careless
I was nineteen and afraid
But you deserve more from me
I don't know why I would say those things
But you deserve more than me
And I'm trying every day

You were a shot in the dark
You were the baby teeth I buried
You were the sounds of distant cars
You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You were the banner that says ""no one""
That I tattooed across my heart
You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You scattered like ashes across every song that I write
You’re where the light pollution starts

I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up

I plan on collapsing and I could have sworn I heard a car door slam
I'm stuck at the corner of grinding teeth and stomach acid
All alone under a soft rain and streetlamp
I spent my life weighed down by a stone heart
Drowning in irony and settling for anything
Somewhere down the line all the wiring went faulty
I'm scared shitless of failure and I'm staring out at where I wanna be

I just want to sell out my funeral
I just want to be enough for everyone
I just want to sell out my funeral
Know that I fought until the lights were gone

I'm walking through harbors and churchyards
I felt the snow crack under my feet
I'll stay thankful for mild winters, for every shot I got at anything
I'll blame the way that I was brought up or the flaws that I was born with
Or the mistakes that I've made
They're all just fucking excuses
So bury me in the memories of my friends and family
I just need to know that they were proud of me

I just want to sell out my funeral
I just want to be enough for everyone
I just want to sell out my funeral
Know that I fought until the lights were gone

And oh, we all wanna know
Where'd the American dream go?
Did you give up and go home?
Am I here alone?
And oh, when the credits roll
I'll watch as the screen glows
The moments when I choked, all the fears that I've outgrown
At least I hope so

I was just happy to be a contender
I was just aching for anything
And I used to have such steady hands
But now I can't keep them from shaking

Oh I'm sorry I...
I'm sorry I don't laugh at the right times
Is this what it feels like with my wings clipped?
I'm awkward and nervous
I'm awkward and nervous
I'm awkward and nervous
I'm awkward and nervous
I'm awkward and nervous

But I was kind of hoping you'd stay
I was kind of hoping you'd stay
I was kind of hoping you'd stay
I need you to stay
Oh, god, could you stay?
I need you to stay
I need you to stay
I need you

Two blackbirds on a highway sign
Are laughing at me here with my wings clipped
I'm staring up at the sky
But the bombs keep fucking falling
There's no devil on my shoulder
He's got a rocking chair on my front porch
But I won't let him in
No, I won't let him in

'Cause I'm sick of seeing ghosts
And I know how it's all gonna end
There's no triumph waiting
There's no sunset to ride off in
We all want to be great men
And there's nothing romantic about it
I just want to know that I did all I could with what I was given",https://images.genius.com/229664fe4a08cdc983ab29029279d889.960x960x1.jpg

After two weeks in the dark
If you've gotta tell me you're not using
It's probably 'cause you are

Just a block off the sea, you're a rowhome
On an empty street where the others have been torn down
And you're the last one standing

It must get lonely
It must get lonely

When the gray starts to swallow gray
Where the sky meets the Irish sea
Like a suit that's been to too many funerals
And starts fraying at the seams
I saw a bag of clementines split right open on an English street
And the contrast made me feel so goddamn dizzy

I saw you there
A block off the sea, you're a rowhome
On an empty street
The others have been torn down
You're the last one standing

It must get obvious enough that I'm not ever gonna change
It must get obvious enough, I'm the one who stays

But it must get lonely
It must get lonely
But it must get lonely
But it must get lonely

I'm a specter in the dim light on the flowers by the grave
In the Montmartre in Paris
Where the crows seem to know my name
And they left footprints in the snow
Along the fence on Palmer Street
Cigarette butts on the headstones
That you left for me

I saw you there
Just a block off the sea, you're a rowhome
On an empty street where the others have been torn down
And you're the last one standing

It must get obvious enough that I'm not ever gonna change
It must get obvious enough that I'm the one who stays

You did the same with your old army surplus blade
My blood's never as warm as I expect it
You grabbed my hand adorned in wildflower warpaint
You made yellows out of marigolds
You made purple out of camellias

We charged headfirst into the woods with bows and arrows drawn
Crudely fashioned-- sticks and rubber bands and spray paint
We swore ourselves protectors from all the evil in the world
You weren't born my brother, but you're gonna die that way

You ran alone (you ran alone)
In the falling snow
Barefoot down Whites Road
I watched your bruises grow (your bruises grow)
Strangely beautiful
Purple and yellow
You said don't
""Don't take me home
Don't take me home
Don't take me home""

Your father came in angry like a thunderstorm
Tossed you room from room and I watched color draining from your face
Fault lines started forming underneath all of your floorboards
We sat terrified waiting on an earthquake
I watched you put on a brave face
I wanted so badly to be brave

But you ran alone (you ran alone)
In the falling snow
Bare foot down Whites Road
I watched your bruises grow (your bruises grow)
Strangely beautiful
Purple and yellow
You said don't

Kicked you out to teach you what a man is
But I don't think I'll ever know what that means
They'll put a gun into your hand and call you weak until you're violent
Don't believe it
They're hateful cause they're empty
We've got a chance to break the cycle

With bad attitudes and
You should come by at eleven
You haven't seen the new apartment
We'll laugh about the shit we got into in high school
And I can't pretend

I'm afraid that we're wasting away
Cause we're all sleeping in circles
Or talking shit in diners
And I've been better, but I'm feeling okay
I'm not even sad anymore
I'm just so tired most nights

And I've been drowning my sorrows
In Lucky Charms and Soy Milk
These are the things that keep me sane
Getting pretzels at midnight behind my house
At the price you can't complain
We set off fireworks
Piss off the whole neighborhood
They keep me up having sex anyway
This stoop has seen much worse
We'll set off a few more
Maybe I'll blow off a piece of this city I hate

How me and Hemingway share forehead scars

In a world that I can't fix
With a hammer in my grip

Out across the great plains

We filled it up with furniture and concrete

The lines were simple and clean
And now the people I was taught would be heroes
Are acting like cowards, killers, and thieves

I’m listening to traffic reports one on one
Coming quietly undone

Away from anything good

Sun-drenched pavement in my blood

Is find a way out for when shit gets bad, and

Like a kid in the sixties
Staring at the sky
Waiting for the bomb to fall
And it’s all a lie
What they say about stability
It scares me sometimes
The emptiness I see in my eyes
And all the kids' names I’ve ever liked
Are tied to tragedy
And I don’t want my children growing up to be
Anything like me

I wanna rip him from his nest

Grinding my teeth
Confused and alone and taking pills to sleep

I'll buy you a candle, not even sure what it means
But I cursed at the matches
And drown in my grief, grief
An older man stood close by, and smiled at me
I rung the bell like he did
I told you I'm sorry
A makeshift funeral, I tried to set you free

You're half asleep
And I bought you a radio to drown out the machines
Hospital light, you asked about the weather, wished that they'd let you outside

They'll hold your service tomorrow
I'm an ocean away
Reached into my pocket, found a small paper crane
It's been over a year now
April turns into May
I've barely stopped moving, I've been so fucking afraid
Too much of a coward to even visit your grave

You're half awake
And I bought you a radio to play the blues away
With my hand to hold, you asked about the weather, wish they'd let you die at home

Tells me to buy a gun

Like it's an arms race
Like death don't mean nothing
To know the heavy price of living poor
Walled in by red lines, backed into a corner
Not knowing growing up what it's like to belong here in America

Nothing's left up to gray
It's black or white and sometimes black and blue
It's something we're all born into, whoa-oh

Not just my father
Three-fifths a man makes half of me
Why should I bother?
Merchants of misery stacking the deck
Fuck your John Waynes
Fuck your God complex

But can't reach far enough
To touch those fever dreams

Through the summer time

Danced on the ice until it breaks

And choked the life out of him slowly

And you point to where the South Sister should be behind the clouds
I'm haunted by the ghosts of right now

The entire coast is out of water
It's turning different shades of grey
Like watching somebody you love
As they slowly waste away
And you looked skinny at my wedding
Sick of carrying the weight
Of all the doctors and all the treatments and all the reasons to be afraid

Right around when you left
I said that I would start believing
If they made you well again
Guess they knew it was bullshit
Never hold up my end
All the walls are stained in nicotine
I could feel closing in

I heard somebody cry
I thought I was alone
I came to numb my lungs in the salt air
Let the breakers heal my bones
I wish that the current would carry me home
I've been running for a decade now
And I think I'm ready to go
Oh, I'm ready to go

I stopped making deals with God
When the light finally died
I'm gonna guard what's left of the good in us
When the ash blocks out the sky
And hold you with my left hand
And ball up my right
And if the bastards come for both of us
I'll be right there by your side
I'm by your side

When I was in shambles
When I got too weak
The ocean grew hands to hold me
When I was in shambles
When I got too weak
The ocean grew hands to hold me

I stopped blaming God
When you said you were sick
I learned to lean on the people who love me
When the sutures start to split
I trust in the current to pull you back in
I miss everyone at once
But most of all, I miss the ocean",https://images.genius.com/7eaeb31e6a9b8c1663db0e7ae751e26e.600x600x1.jpg

That I found deep in the desert
The air sweet as a miracle
It can't survive but it grows and grows and grows
West Texas is dying slow
An oil rig in the sunset
The air is heavy and filled with smoke
There ain't no quit in the hands that built this home
A dog barks in the distance
Rusted frames take root in the brush

You'll watch it decay
Lie through your teeth and say you'll resurrect a ghost
The paper tigers you made then swore to keep away
You're a knife there at my throat
God, take me back to the orange grove

Fall came quiet and sudden
They're smoking out of their storm doors
Work left town with the summer
We're just trying to keep warm
That cough don't sound any better
Another month, try to push through
Blood in your spit in the morning
Give a fake name at the emergency room
There at the edge of losing everything
Taking desperate swings in the dark

You'll watch it decay
Lie through your teeth and say you'll resurrect a ghost
The paper tigers you made then swore to keep away
You're a knife there at my throat

When your mom got sick so slow
Did you carry the weight alone?
When the bills started to grow
Did you carry the weight alone?
When the bank came for your home
Did you carry the weight alone?
When you reap what they sow
Do you carry the weight alone?

And consequently, he also saved the Pina Colada industry

These northeast winters make boys into men
Staring out at snow-plowed mountains
In the parking lots of churches
The city just felt worn out
No strength to pick our hearts off the ground
We watched the '92 Birds take the field without Jerome Brown

Sew the world together tightly
Cinch the gaps with pins and string
And the beacon out there on the wing
It lights the clouds from inside out
And from the ground we look like lightning

(To pack your things and make a break for the door)
One day the things you love are gonna put you in the ground

It swallowed up everything

In the sea of trees
I thought that I'd hear ghosts in the waves
When the wind blew through
I heard joy return to a cold and lonesome place

Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess, I watched you wake up and get dressed
You left the room receded like my hairline
I've been avoiding Rittenhouse like the plague
Because I just can't handle seeing you today
You made this house into a home
Now, I'm a stranger on my street
And as I turned to leave
I caught myself in the mirror to see I aged a year this week
I left a note up on your bed that said
""Hey, thanks again for everything you did""
Hey Jess, I woke up older
Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess, I watched you wake up and get dressed
You left the room receded like my hairline
When John introduced ""Woke Up New"" in St. Augustine

When I woke up here without you
There was nothing to do but pack up and go home

On the carpet with the window open wide

Your breath frozen in the air
Newborn droplets of ice

I'm measuring heartbeats in miles away
You held me together
I used to burst and decay
We got off the airplane
A couple of runaways
I was hoping you'd stay
Could you stay?
You were the obvious one
(From a taxi cab in Chelsea
Out past Salvation Mountain)
You were the obvious one
(From a walk along the highline
Out to Wicker Park in August)
You were the obvious one
(From your Upper East Side dorm room
To the South West Marin Headlands
With you smiling in the sand
Goddamn, I hate leaving)

I ran the dishwasher this morning
I wanted there to be clean plates for you tonight

It hangs in the morning light

I buried half of a decade there
It was the better part
You'd catch the reference if only you could hear
Because I still hear you in the bass drum beat after ""I'll Catch You""
I'm left wondering if you meant anything when you typed out
""You never got me down, Ray. I never went down""

Don't be nervous, my love
Just follow your heartstrings
I hope they tug to the rhythm of the beat

They decorate the living room like a neon stage
At the happiest place in the world
Until the lights turn off and I wake up

I'll row my boat a million miles west just to brave this rapid current
And meet you up ahead
Separation is a test that I have questioned on behalf
Of what risks are worth taking and what mistakes I can subtract
From this equation

Sketchy parking lots we consider our homes
I know it sounds crazy, yet
We fall hard asleep, it's rare that we worry
We're only here until we are gone
So somebody, will you tell me what's the
Hurry?
Fingers crossed that the cops don't come
And I'm one hundred percent
Positive
That we never found all the empty cans
Under the van seats
We're too busy sharing stories
And laughing
About how boring

If there's nobody trying to make the best of everything

I refuse to feel
To suffer is human, I'm using excuses
Anticipate the war

Before dependencies weigh down on me

I control my own fear and my shame
Naked in a world that doesn't owe me anything

Give all you got
Get nothing back
Footprints will leave no impression
Without a weight that I will have to choose to bear
I succumb to short term benefits, left with long term deficit
The choices I made are not made to help
A bottomless pit always has further down
Save me from myself

We could talk through our demons with steps retraced
Help me to understand your space
All I saw for years was red
Focus my gaze, time elapsed
Pen hits the page and I regret the act
Nine years of writing so angry, misguided

It’s done between you and me
Echoes in the canyon sing
""You don’t owe her anything""
""You don’t owe her anything""

You buried me, submerged the seed

A lesson learned never again will I go down so easily

Tough to break through venom you spewed
What did you do? Tell me the truth
Manipulation in the guise of a mother
Some things can never be yours to take
To force forgiveness harbours pain like no other
My hands remain steady inside I shake

Another crutch to add to my story
Find strength of mind, withered demons pushed aside
A new chapter overnight cause when the fuck else?
My only trick, finding hope in convictions
So one day when this ends I can say I’d relive it all

The easy way out never led me anywhere
And I, I always end up way too deep inside my head

The stagnant water that fills Tring Quarry
Was the lowest that I’ve ever seen it today
Stuck with the feeling that life only plays
Its significant songs when I’m feeling grey

Frustrated, an understatement

Forgetting memories, parts of me
Thoughts of how it used to be
Bleeding contentment we come undone one by one
I was secure, so sure of myself
But I’ve been down this road before
Its quit, relapse forevermore

And the scenario always played out the same:
Lonely, alone, and with no money
So it looks like for once, I've done something right

I crept inside your head but I can’t pretend
I know a single thing about what you’ve been feeling
A heavy burden to withhold, take my word a tortured soul
Is not a secret worth keeping
The sum of all fears closing in over these last few years
It pulls you under, so much deeper than I can venture
The light you knew, overcome with black and blue
Become the light, see me through

So, I'm, I’m writing songs, staying strong
Call me back, it’s been so long

Like a falling tide, I recede to the void and belong
Until the better half of my indifference proves me wrong
Scars heal in time but I’m bleeding inside
If I’m honest you haven’t left me very hopeful
But I hope you’re wrong
And I promise agony won’t be the only voice I carry on
Call me back, it's been so long

So I’m writing songs, staying strong
Call me back, it’s been so long
Life just like you always said
“If it can it will go wrong”

Off the ropes I’m already gone
Always falling could you call me back it’s been so long

What a spectacular view
All those old Irish songs at my grandfather's funeral
Seventeen candles on a birthday cake
Seems like yesterday

Fell in and out of love and hard drugs
Found my heart in Los Angeles

It keeps you out of the rain
Don't let those sad songs rot your brain

I'll hold the wheel while you light your cigarette
Burning down the highway out of here
My twenties clipping at my heels
I've been killing myself just to know how it feels

Laid out on my childhood bed
To the sound of “Sam's Town” and my hands behind my head

“Don't say it if you don't mean it.”

I'll watch the summer sun set in my two hands
And I'll hold it there forever, forever my friends

Did I do all that I could do with my time
How can we say that we were unprepared
I made the best of all the chances given
But we grew up too fast

We left it there nothing but a hole in the ground
It wasn’t where that we came from
It always felt like when that we called home
Those two years they made us who we are
They made us family and brought us this far
We ripped our skin so we can’t shake it off
We march on and tell our story’s by our scars

To prove that I'm worth it

Behind my pen
It only goes to paper
What comes off my chest

Through the nights I wake up alone in my sheets soaking wet
To the sound of your voice saying “come home” still ringing in my ear
And this world's got a funny way of being cruel to me

With all of your jewellery in it
I gave your pearl earrings
To the girl I love

Never had a thing to do
Raised by wolves an understatement by far

Wasted the same old story
Fucked up my priorities
Chin two last cigarettes and scramble for a taxi
Hit the bar
Get some drinks
Even though we're feeling rough
Go find girls
Strut our stuff
But never gain any luck
Long walks late nights
We'd always find a street light
Try to piece together why we'd always had a shit time
But nevertheless I would never change that
'Cause that was how we rolled
It will be till we're old

I've got a pocket full of regrets and I thank you for that
Still can’t look myself in the mirror
Still kick myself for thinking we were better
Didn't return my calls what’s the matter?
You washed your hands of me and I get it

,Promiscuous,Identity Crisis,2018-08-31,"What does it feel like to get clocked by promiscuous eyes?
Would I be alright if I tried all my best pick-up lines?
Rejection dancing through my head
Hope the tension here's unread
What does it feel like?

Now every dickhead in the room is eyeing you up
Keep your dignity sealed up in case you lose some
The drinks are mixing with the tracks that you think you love
Dismiss the voices in your head that tell you you've had enough
The sorry tale of drugs and how you use them

Where did I go wrong?
'Cos you're leaving
And you're with him
Invertebrate, you're spineless
Your dirty fate decided
I knew it all along

If you said we're good then I guess we're good for now
But if I hear more lies, in a bit bright eyes, peace out
Won't call you when I get home
You'll barely cross my head
Guess I'll just leave you to it
So nice to know ya (know ya)
The next day knows you don't wanna
But we both know that you're gonna
Get all up close and personal
So please don't take this the wrong way
But your mates can say what they wanna say
Cos you're out of my peripheral

Where did I go wrong?
'Cos you're leaving
And you're with him
Invertebrate, you're spineless
Your dirty fate decided
I knew it all along

I wanna know where I went wrong
Why am I on my own?
Please tell me what could it be
Already know
Will you stay
When you don't come home
You don't come home to me
What does it feel like
To get clocked by promiscuous eyes?
Would I be alright
If I tried all my best pick-up lines?

What does it feel like?
Would I be alright?

Tainted by this movie scene you paved the way for in-between
I miss being a kid
How I long for blissful ignorance
All the fucks that I didn't give
Got called back up in your absence
This holiday never went to plan
So incase I never see you again I said
Maybe I’m a fucking joke
The punchline to a thousand TV episodes
So tell me is this movie really set in stone?
Or can I improvise the lines and take you home?
Colour me cautious when I’d call you 20 times again
It's getting out of hand
Your voicemail never understands
Laying down this old red carpet just to watch you leave
From on set reality is never what it seems
I can't breathe it's hard to inhale through the smoke from your gun
Cut me deep remove my insides ‘cause I won't need them
Maybe I’m a fucking joke

See to my drought 'till I feel no more
One more shot, cherry on top
Fuels my inner demon
Knock it back 'till I see black
Body relaxed, talking to the floor
Rest assured, I can do more
But I guess I should be leaving
I wanna carry on, carry on, shocking
Carry on, carry on
Hey now, riddle me this
Beneath this wrist is a pulse that needs to slow down
Cure my itch I run the risk of falling underground
I'm down, I'm out
I'm like one more bottle off the drop, fell south
There's no signs of giving up
We took a big hit
We started feeling it
Let's float away
(Let's float away)
Come with me, we'll take a free ride
On a land slide to the dark side
I'll show you everything I can't hide
Under moonlight
Where the dead lie

Carry on, carry on
We'll carry on till we're all rotten

It's been about a year it feels like ten
I swore to love you 'till the bitter end
Guess I meant it
So I;ll pull out a cigarette and light it
You tell me I'm a dick and I should quit
You made a comment about the shape I'm in
Thought I missed it
Woah

We're all going on a twisted holiday
We left it all behind in case tomorrow never came
If this is it I guess I'm in
Who needs conventional anyways
So you can come with me
Through the falling leaves
There'll be no need for farewell
'Cos I know I'll see you in hell

I've got years on you kid
But you knew me better than I did
Blame the rows on being passionate
Funny isn't it?
We could swap love for tears and resentment
Don't fuck with this happy ending
I can't deny that I'm tempted
Just don't take the piss girl

My voice is shot and these walls are not sound proof
But we'll never look back
Though it's matter of fact
That the neighbours must have had a funny view
Of me and you

I need to call it quits before I lose a friend
I feel so wrong now
Have for so long now
I try to brush it off but silly me I’m at it again

I’m a state a case infatuated
Possibly
Now all your favourite calls from me
Are dime a dozen these days
I’ll be heavily intoxicated
Probably
It trends these days when I’m away
We both head back to basics
I’ll say
Are we close to the end
Yeah you best just be friends
I’m breaking

I need to call it quits before I lose a friend
I feel so wrong now
Have for so long now
I try to brush it off but silly me I’m at it again

So here’s a tip for free
You better use it wisely
Scrap what I said last week
We’ll talk when we’re dead just ignore me
Roll in after dark
One too many shots
I’m oblivious to this until you fill me in
I sleep with my door open
Just so you can stumble in and we can go again
Can’t get up cos we’re baked
Sleep in creased sheets for days
Yeah I’ll never find my space
Cos I know you’re filling it
Call me up
Common ground
Give it ten we’ll be sound
Now we both know
What’s going on

I try to brush it off but silly me I’m at it again
I need to call it quits before I lose a friend
I feel so wrong now
Have for so long now
I try to brush it off but silly me I’m at it again
I try to take a shot so pity me or just pretend
It’s getting boring just ignore me till we’re dead
I feel so wrong now
Have for so long now
I try to brush it off but silly me I’m at it again

I hate to be that guy
So I try
And I try
To hold it what she says we’re falling to pieces

I try to brush it off but silly me I’m at it again
I need to call it quits before I lose a friend

Judgement clouded by desire
I swear it's nothing more
I swear it's nothing more
Now my leverage is slack it's getting too loose to fit
And that red dot on your back tells me you're used to this
So I'll cut the cord
Shut you out
Spit your taste out of my mouth
My head feels so fucked up today
I guess I'll have to find a way to
Leave you here and pack up for South Drive
Back off I've done my stint I've served my time
Stitched my mouth
Covered your lies
Someday I'll cut you down to size
So I'll cut the cord
Shut you out
I'm sick of all the shit you spout
My head feels so fucked up today
I guess I'll have to find a way to
Leave you here and pack up for South Drive
Before I get sore eyes will you please rest them for me
So worn out from the doubt of your false sincerity
Cause the clock's on the click I'll throw in the towel and quit
I guess well cross that bridge
I guess well cross that bridge
I've been thinking about leaving
This time next year I won't be here

We're a tight fit so I'll stay

No one gives you chills like I do
Jealousy will do us part till death
Onto my funeral date
Odds on that I'll be late
‘Cause I got out of the wrong side of my death bed
And I’ve never been a morning person
Daytimes just keep getting worse
And another night alone will tip me over the edge

Prone to a phase

Still try when they
Offer me guidance and an ear
