Pitching myself for leads in other people's dreams
Now buzz, buzz, buzz
Doc, there's a hole where something was
Doc, there's a hole where something was

Fell out of bed, butterfly bandage, but don't worry
You'll never remember, your head is far too blurry
Put him in the back of a squad car, restrain that man
He needs his head put through a cat scan
Hey editor, I'm undeniable
Hey Doctor, I'm certifiable

Oh, I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I'm half doomed and you're semi-sweet

So boycott love
Detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
Perfect boys
With their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)

Oh, little girl, you got me staring odd
Or was that just a telescopic camera nod
Painted dolls in the highway, truck stop stalls
Lot lizards scales cool my nightlife moods
All the rookies leave your badge and your gun on the desk, when you leave the room

I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I am half doomed and you're semi-sweet

So boycott love
Detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life

I've been sitting, I've been thinking
Man it's been so hard to cope
And I took your stupid pictures from off of the mantle shelf
But I can't erase your voices from my head
Is it too soon because..
Remember when I told you that we couldn't work it out?
Remember when I told you all about these stupid doubts?
Well I wrote 1000 letters couldn't send a single one
Telling you that I have changed my mind
And you won't let me get you off my mind..
What can I do?
It hurts like hell but hell, what can I do?
It's been a couple weeks and still I've gotten no reply
I've been sitting, contemplating, forcing myself not to cry
And I can't help but think that everything has gone all wrong
And I miss hearing you tell me ""it's alright""
Is it too soon because..
Remember when I told you that we couldn't work it out?
Remember when I told you all about these stupid doubts?
Well I wrote 1000 letters couldn't send a single one

And you won't let me get you off my mind..
What can I do?
It hurts like hell but hell, what can I do?
You've got a lot of problems
And I'd love to help you out

NOFX,Creeping Out Sara,Coaster,1/1/2009,"I was backstage at a festival in Germany
Talking to a cute, fair-skinned brunette
I asked her if she wanted to have a beer
And if she liked our set
I noticed that her hair was longer in the back
I figured that's cause she's Canadian
That's why I was surprised when she told me she was fully lesbian
That's when I realized it was Sara
Or maybe it was Tegan
I'm pretty sure that it was Sara
Cause Johnny Samson said she was the cool one
I told her that I was a big fan of her band
She asked me if I had a favourite song
I admitted that I never actually heard them
But I like K.D. Lang
I told her this Jew knows about the Junos
And how they got robbed three times in a row
And then I asked her if she knew of anyone
Who's selling pills or blow
That's when I creeped out Sara
Or maybe I just pissed her
Off when I asked her if her sister
And her had ever had a threesome
Where they both ganged up on one girl
A fourgy or a fivesome
Do they think strap-ons are groovy
And had they ever seen the movie
""Bound"", and did they like Jennifer Tilly?
Did they like Jennifer Tilly?
Sara said she
Preferred Gina Gershon
Angelina Jolie
In that ""Gia"" movie
That was on HBO
And ""If These Walls Could Talk""
Made Tegan cry alot
After that I almost forgot what she said
That's the problem with Diazepam
So many things I don't remember
But I got a sinking feeling
It's not that I'm a clair-
-voyant but I think I creeped out Sara
I was creeping out on Sara
I hope it wasn't Tegan
Cause Skiba said she is the cooler one",36

A Day to Remember,Another Song About the Weekend,Homesick,2/3/2009,"They keep playing sad songs on the radio

Says they don't know what I've become

""The leads are weak; fucking leads are weak? You're weak.""

Remember when America had a middle class and an upper class?
That was way before the exodus
That was the America that we thought was number one
Thought would overcome, thought would never die
That was just our pride and faith: two shitty deadly sins;
I know faith isn't one of 'em but it should have been
Cause when things were crumbling, we had no camaraderie
Just a faith someone would save us from despondence

We called it America, whoa
We called it America, whoa

""Number one America"" was a slogan used
To keep morale up when we knew we were already cooked
Then the richer western states
Succeeded in secession and the eastern ones followed right behind
Mexi-Can-America was the perfect name
That epitomized the order of significance, authority and affluence
We had turned it all around, went from number one, straight to number two (shit)

Born on the 4th of July
Raised in the era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive
I am a nation, a worker of pride
My debt to the status quo
The scars on my hands are a means to an end
It's all that I have to show

I swallowed my pride and I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers and lied through my teeth
The pillar of damage control
I've been to the edge and I've thrown the bouquet
Of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room wasting my time
And waiting for judgement day

I praise liberty
""The Freedom to Obey,""

I can't even sleep from the light's early dawn
Oh, scream, America, scream

Your confession will be crucified
You're a sacrificial suicide
Like a dog that's been sodomized, well
(Stand up!) All the white boys
(Sit down!) And the black girls
(Stand up!) You're the soldiers
(Sit down!) Of the new world

Put your faith in a miracle
And it's non-denominational
Join the choir, we'll be singing
In the church of wishful thinking

A fire burns, today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Oh, bless me, Lord, for I have sinned
It's been a lifetime since I last confessed
I threw my crutches in ""the river of a shadow of doubt""
And I'll be dressed up in my Sunday best

Say a prayer for the family
Drop a coin for humanity
Ain't this uniform so flattering?
I never asked you a goddamn thing!

A fire burns, today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Don't test me
Second-guess me
Protest me
You will disappear

I want to know who's allowed to breed
All the dogs who never learned to read
Missionary politicians
And the cops of the new religion

A fire burns, today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the inside

Look out to the setting sun, the brink of your vision
Eternal youth is a landscape of a lie
The cracks of my skin can prove, as the years will testify
Say your prayers and light a fire, we're gonna start a war
Your slogan's a gun for hire, it's what we waited for
Hey, Gloria, this is why we're on the edge
The fight of our life's been drawn to this undying love

Gloria! Viva la Gloria!
You blast your name in graffiti on the walls
Falling through broken glass that's slashing through your spirit
I can hear it like a jilted crowd
Gloria! Where are you, Gloria?
You found a home in all your scars and ammunition
You made your bed in salad days amongst the ruins
Ashes to ashes of our youth

She smashed her knuckles into winter (Gloria!)
As autumn's wind fades into black
She is the saint of all the sinners (Gloria!)
The one that's fallen through the cracks
So don't put away your burning light!

Gloria! Where are you, Gloria?
Don't lose you faith to your lost naivety
Weather the storm and don't look back on last November
When your banners were burning down
Gloria! Viva la Gloria!
Send me your amnesty down to the broken hearted
Bring us the season that we always will remember
Don't let the bonfires go out!

So, Gloria, send out your message of
The light that shadows in the night
Gloria, where's your undying love?
Tell me the story of your life
Your life!",1

Inside your restless soul, your heart is dying
Little one, little one, your soul is purging
Of love and razor blades, your blood is surging

Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the Salvation Army
There is no place like home when you got no place to go

Little girl, little girl, your life is calling
The charlatans and saints of your abandon
Little one, little one, the sky is falling
Your lifeboat of deception is now sailing
In the wake, all the way, no rhyme or reason
Your bloodshot eyes will show your heart of treason
Little girl, little girl, you dirty liar
You're just a junkie preaching to the choir

Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the Salvation Army
There is no place like home when you got no place to go

The traces of blood always follow you home
Like the mascara tears from your getaway (Gloria!)

Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?


When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight

Throw up your arms into the sky
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight

And run from them, from them
With no direction
We'll run from them, from them
With no conviction

Traveling endlessly
Don't need no roads

And we just go in circles

And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it
Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds
So I can find someone to rely on

And run to them, to them
Full speed ahead

We are just

Misguided ghosts
Traveling endlessly

Pushed us far away

Deep in my soul, that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone, but keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Towards a goal that's non existent

No one wants to hear your sappy bullshit
All these fake-tan girls laughing at art school kids
Getting lots in return for being substanceless
You're too caught in semantics to see it
But you're no fucking different

So they're calling it blasphemy
A fucking catastrophe
For saying it's a stupid choice to make
But this place just brings misery
I hate what it does to me
I fight, but I can't escape the way that I don't fit in with any of this
And I don't think we're the same

I'm not sad anymore, I'm just waiting
It's two more months 'til I'm done with this

I'm twenty three and avoiding the bar scene
Lycra pants, and designer jeans
In case you were wondering
I'm staying in
I won't smell like cheap perfume or cigarettes tonight
And every word that I said got drowned out
By a dance remix of a pop song I don't care about
In case you forgot how bad I've been down

Can someone tell these kids liking the rain no longer counts as an idiosyncrasy

I fell in love before the morning arrived
She wore a blue dress to combat the heat
Drank beer from a bottle and danced in the street
Then I heard her singing something fairly familiar
A tale of two lovers in the thick of the summer
There in the moment, we kissed in the hammock
We argued over which Bad Religion album was better
Well, I thought 'No Control' or 'Suffer'
And then she became queen of the neighborhood parties
'Cause I was an unknown boy along for the ride
Kept the guitar right by my side
It was better than conversing with the kids I didn't like
But on the fourth of July, when the fireworks rang out
She met a new boy who was more hip and less strung out
I drove home with fire in the sky
Fiddled with the dials and stumbled across something
That you were always humming
As time tables suggest
We were only just friends
In constant motions, covering stilts
I'll give you a dollar for another ride home
Or something to mix with your Coke
Well maybe if you want to wander around outside tonight
Meet me in Lake Ariel after midnight
Or really whenever, I only want to talk
I only want to relive what was lost

Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low

If you take it from me, live your life for yourself
Cause when it's all said and done, you don't need anyone else
C'mon!

So let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
Not a worry in the world, tell me was this all worth it?
I get what I want so everyone's always judging me
I'm not afraid of anything, I've got the whole world in front of me

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low

Keep your heads down low, keep your heads down low
Keep your hopes up high, and your heads down low",11

Forever by your side, No matter what I was going through
But now I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me, guess, I was always wrong

I gotta do this right, then they can't make a sound
Cause I'm not here for nothing, Least I can say I stand for something

I won't be held back
I can't be held down

You tried to hide, you stood close by, and didn't make a sound
Say something
Find you some paper, and I'll go grab you a pen
You can start taking notes on how this all started again
Been dead last, but found my way to the front
With my inspirational quotes on why I never gave up
Where were you when my walls came falling down? (They came falling down)
You tried to hide, you stood close by, and didn't make a sound
Where were you when it all came back around? (It goes back around)

So just wait you'll know

Forget everything just for tonight, we'll sing like everyone when they're alone

I rely on myself, just making sure that was clear
I'm not in need of your crutches I faced all my fears
And I won, well
I knew I could have, life is not a punch card, make the best of what you have

Don't wait, just go, and when you find yourself please let me know
It's not too late, just let go

Forget everything just for tonight
We'll sing like everyone when they're alone

We're a force that can shake the whole world
For once we're doing something right when we say, (Whoa, whoa)

In the end it's not about what you have
In the end, it's all about where you want to go
And the roads you take to help you get there
I hope you think that's fair

Don't know the person inside it and that's never been any clearer
I miss your family and I miss all our friends
If you had it to do over would you do it over again
Cause I would, this meant something more to me
There's a hole in my heart where you used to be

I still wish you the best of luck, baby
And don't go thinking this was a waste of time
I couldn't forget you if I tried

You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I'll live with regret for my whole life

I confess that I brought this all on myself
Condemned to suffer alone, like there's nobody else
When you're gone, it's like a whole part of me's missing
So I'll keep living the lie and just hope that you're listening
I tried to make us a life here
But our foundation was built on sand
No time to run until the damage was done
And I've never had the upper hand

All the things you love are all the things I hate
How did we get here in the first place?

I play it cool but it's hard to be (All my trust)
Is slowly burning inside of me (Over what)
There can't be anymore progress, I know our fate
The only thing that can heal this is time and space

You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me

I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you

I was broken, I was choking, I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding, stopped believing, could have died
This song saved my life
I was down, I was drowning, but it came on just in time
This song saved my life

Sometimes I feel like you've known me forever
You always know how to make me feel better
Because of you my dad and me
Are so much closer than we used to be
You're my escape when I'm stuck in a small town
I turn you up whenever I feel down
You let me know like no one else
That it's okay to be myself

I was broken, I was choking, I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding, stopped believing, could have died
This song saved my life

Breaking finger nails while I claw at the frozen ground
Because as long as I'm home
I can dig up these bones
There's no point to just letting go
And as long as you've known me I've been backing out slowly
I won't end up underneath the snow, the snow
This is where it's been
The manger scene every Christmas
Next to the cannon
Every year someone steals baby Jesus
Nobody stops them
It's a nice tradition
I'll put my life back together in silence
While writing songs on Molly's guitar
And Suburbia, stop pushing
I know what I'm doing
So I moved myself and two boxes of things
To the basement room at Richie's house
And I'm happy here for now
Because I've been in search of some steadier footing
Or just a place to call home
I know that I'm introspective when broken
But I've been spending most of my nights here alone
And that doesn't scare me like it did a year ago
I'll put my life back together in silence
While writing songs on Molly's guitar

I know what I'm doing
Suburbia, stop pushing
I know what I'm doing

As the Allen Ginsberg of this generation

And humming like we've healed

And out of our old apartment
I know things changed but I'm not sure when
I guess you'd call this regression
I left a real job and a girlfriend
I convinced myself that I'm brave enough for all of this
Well, I spent this whole year in airports
And the floor feels like home
Oh, at least we're never alone
I lost track of the time zones and I'd call but you know

I'm running on empty
The late nights and the long drives start to get to me
I'm just so tired

I spent this year as a ghost and I'm not sure what I'm looking for
I'm a voice on a phone that you rarely answer anymore
I came in here alone
Came in here alone
(But that doesn't scare me like it did seven months ago)
I spent this year as a ghost and I'm not sure where home is anymore

Been on a steady fast food diet
Like we're this generation's Morgan Spurlock
But we don't admit defeat
My body feels rejected and I can't say that I blame it
My heart keeps saying stay young
My lower back seems to disagree
I unrolled a cheap cotton blanket on an old dirty couch
I felt the year start to wind down
I can't stand any dead space
Empty beds bum me out

Where the waitresses are girls that graduated with me
Have problems with oxy, and can't recall what I had to drink
No one knows where they're going
They just know they want out of here badly
Like cigarettes dropped on a highway
They smash, and scatter, and burn out
Somewhere else without knowing

And just a hint of a South Philly accent
I was born here

The kids in the graduating class
Have got their eyes set west
And California on their lips
But I left some blood there, that I'm never getting back
Rocky's in the Deep South, I don't think he's coming back now

Growing up means
Watching my heroes turn human in front of me
And the songs we wrote at eighteen
Seem shortsighted and naive
So when the weather breaks
I'll pull my hoodie up over my face
I won't run away, run away
'Cause as fucked as this place got, it made me me

This town's got lies to tell
I'll wait around to hear you out

No one, no one's gonna take that away from me
We don't have trouble sleeping

Fuck some movie that I swore Keanu Reeves was in
These doomsday prophesies are all gonna amount to nothing
And so, for now, I'm calling bullshit
If the Mayans don't believe it, why should I be any different?

So I stacked a Bukowski novel on a Blacklisted LP
And this time what it looked like was just what it proved to be
You said you needed a stiff drink to take your mind off things
Hey Jess, I woke up older
Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess, I watched you wake up and get dressed
You left the room receded like my hairline
I've been avoiding Rittenhouse like the plague
Because I just can't handle seeing you today
You made this house into a home
Now, I'm a stranger on my street
And as I turned to leave
I caught myself in the mirror to see I aged a year this week
I left a note up on your bed that said
""Hey, thanks again for everything you did""
Hey Jess, I woke up older
Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess, I watched you wake up and get dressed
You left the room receded like my hairline
When John introduced ""Woke Up New"" in St. Augustine
I knew I wasn't alone
When I woke up here without you
There was nothing to do but pack up and go home

It was how I know you would want this to be a fast one
And not some cliche ballad
I'm slowing down in the August air
A heavy heart and shaking hands carried you up here
I buried half of a decade there
It was the better part
You'd catch the reference if only you could hear
Because I still hear you in the bass drum beat after ""I'll Catch You""
I'm left wondering if you meant anything when you typed out
""You never got me down, Ray. I never went down""
You know the fucked up part is
I kind of always knew we'd have to write a song about this
You know the fucked up part is
I had my fingers crossed that it wouldn't be for you, kid

When you're standing close to death

Hold on as we crash into the earth
A bit of pain will help you suffer when you're hurt, for real
Cause you were driving me crazy

Bite your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know? I'm here to stay

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I hear are the many echoes of
The darkest words you said
And it's driving me crazy
I can't find the best in all of this
But I'm always looking out for you
Cause you're the one I miss
And it's driving me crazy

Bite your lips, your words a robbery

Saves the Day,Daybreak,Daybreak,9/13/2011,"My heart is gone, it drove to the shore
Swam out in the night, way out past the lines
I heard that now it lives in the South
Of West Central Spain, drinking off the pain
Cause inside I'm broke, I'm cracked, I'm alone
No hope for a change, no way to erase
The world would be better without me
So how could this be, somehow you love me?

Stepped out to see the stars fall alone on the neighbor's lawn
I held my hand up, my head down, waiting to hear your call
I thought I saw your headlights in the dark driving by our house
I'm going out my mind
I'm giving up the fight this time
Love me or let go
No longer care if I die alone
Whole world is waiting, watching to see when you're gonna fall
10,000 faces staring, your back is against the wall
Fucked up past the point of fixing, so tell me what went wrong
I'm going out my mind
I'm giving up the fight this time
Love me or let go
No longer care if I die alone
Cause in the darkness of my mind I used to dream of suicide
I'm gonna pull myself out before I die
I'm going out my mind
I'm giving up the fight this time
Love me or let go
No longer care if I die alone

Now it's 8 in the morning
Up all night just walking around
I'm hiding out here under the window
By the sink where we used to laugh all day long
I wait 'til I see you walking
From the bedroom down to the kitchen
Fingering your hair into curls while talking
On the phone resting on your collarbone
Here I come again, head is hanging low
You put down the phone, take me in your arms
And I'm all alone with you, my love
Did you hear me coming?
Running over the words I said last night
While wishing I never saw your eyes swell up
With tears dripping down your thighs
I can't let it go, I'm lost inside
I can get so low, seems like there's no up
And I'm all alone so take me in your arms
Knowing I'm the one

I turn around to say, ""How could you still love me?""
Sun is shining, lighting up your face
You stare off into space, not knowing what to say
Searching for the words to set things straight
So I say, ""I'm a zig zag, sideways upside down, out of my mind
What's the point of living if we're all just born to die?""
You say, ""Why, why ask why?""
I say, ""I get fucked up.""
You say, ""Delusional.""
Somehow will you still open your arms?
""Come with me."" you say, we step outside to face the sun
Yesterday I dreamed that it would all burn down to dust

Take a breath, turn around
See the sun come through the clouds
The light alive in your eyes
Standing here by your side
Arm in arm under the sky
I know I want to hold on
The letters left on the lawn
The shadows crawling the wall
The mirror shatters and falls
I've been lost for so long
No more will to carry on
So dark and dead and diseased
Nothing left in the end
And to pray is to pretend
I'm tired of trying to believe
So can we learn to forgive?
I want to hold you again
Can we remember our love?
I can get so low, seems like there's no up
And I'm all alone so take me in your arms
Knowing I'm the one",NA

When I don't even know how to save myself?
Wish I could just forget
The double lives, the awkwardness
A union scarred by bitterness
A house we built on top of our regrets
There we were in California
Two tarnished golden hearts
Were we ever really together
Or just afraid of being apart?
I wish I could drive all night
Wake up in the harsh day light
In a different town, start a brand new life
And never have to see your face again

Will ever be broken
I wonder if the spell we're under
Is ever, ever going to end
I guess there's never any closure
Since the last look in our eyes

Faded and fell to the ground

To find the courage to talk aloud

The neon halos shines so bright

Are calling out don't surrender, don't surrender

On these counterfeit guitars
While the ghost of our past ring down the boulevard

Not to dig you up

Specialist Jeg, a much more honest man than you
Came back from the desert where he never found the truth
Now he screeches tires, fills his head with alcohol
While the morbid brown faces hang like portraits on the wall

Had it all, they took it all

Something happened on the way to hell
The old guard, they took my brother away

The same greed, it took our parents
Something happened on the way to hell
The west wall, it took us with it

McTiernan was a good ol' boy, he cheated and he skimmed
""A favor for a favor, it can't be called a sin""
Some may see it different, and some don't see at all
When the papers started calling, he closed his eyes and took the fall

Had it all, took the fall
Had it all, took the fall

Now we're standing on the ledge and we're looking at the ground
I feel my body breaking on the asphalt, hear the sound
Red and blue lights screaming saying step up off that ledge
So we wrap our hearts up in our heads and take the fall instead

I don't care
Learning to do without it

Like nothing at all

See how tame I can be?

And it's too much to take and so I say to myself
""I never told you that I loved you cause I don't.""

Did I ever tell you about that one dream?
Well look, there we are
Where we used to be
Of all things I will soon grow tired

Let them all, let them all feel abuse

Take an ""I"", take an ""s""
Form a stupid sentence and I'm not impressed
You take a person that's so well dressed

Like your life is a map with no compass to guide

Wendy run away with me
I know I sound crazy
Don't you see what you do to me?
I wanna be your lost boy
Your last chance, a better reality
Wendy we can get away
I promise if you're with me say the word and we'll find a way
I can be your lost boy, your last chance
Your ""everything better"" plan
Oh, somewhere in Neverland
Somewhere in Neverland

We'll start a life of the plain and the simple
Of great times with far better people
And weekends with our friends
Laughing about the wine that stains their teeth
We'll talk about how your parents separated and
How you don't wanna make the same mistakes as them
I'll say it's all about stickin' it out
And trying to feel forever young
So here we go again wishing we could start again

Wendy run away with me
I know I sound crazy
Don't you see what you do to me?
I wanna be your lost boy
Your last chance, a better reality

This bed's an island made of feathered down
And I'm stuck here alone
Little else but memories of you on memory foam
Visions of a brighter love, I'd kill for one more day
To pool my thoughts and find the words to say

If these sheets were the states and you were miles away
I'd fold them end over end to bring you closer to me
Because I don't sleep at all without you pressed up against me
I settle for long distance calls

This room's become a mausoleum filled with relics of regret
Paying dues to every moment wasted on words left unsaid
Collisions of a finer love, I'd kill for one more way
To tell you how you make me better every day

Be the new kid on an old block
A chalk outline on a playground blacktop

I'm just a moment so don't let me pass you by
We could be a story in the morning but we'll be a legend tonight
I'm just a moment so don't let me pass you by
And they can speak our names in a dead language
'Cause you and I, we're alive
But just for a moment

I'm twice the man that I thought I was yesterday
Half the time, I'm a world away
A flicker of a soul casting silhouettes
On the face of a town that could not get me to stay
And when the spark's gone, former lovers
Just looking for a bus to throw me under

To create the illusion that our lives are not vacant
But still our hearts are so shattered
We are all speeding with no destination
An imaginary prize until we sadly falter

Hollow children sputtering out
From birth until failure, we march on forever
We are only as strong as the mark we left behind

It was a cold, cold day in December
Your hands were folded
Your heart was silent
What was this boy to you?
How could I possibly stay here without you?
You were a young soul waiting forever
And heaven had finally come for you
I know this much is true
They'll never another one like you

Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm
And you never really know where it goes up until it starts
I got my eye on you
Whatcha gonna do
Day dream near a stream with the linear bites
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night
And I can't picture you but I sure got the feeling right
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl

And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news
And you reached for my hand, I was scared in your room
We fell on the floor and we started to move
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop
Up my back they would climb just as I came unglued

She said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be there to try it again

Nineteen as we roll across the bedroom floor
Your eyes they cannot lie as you're dreaming of our future home
And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl

In the rain with the drink from the back of the bar
I would raise up my voice, you would raise it up more
We'd forget that our lives being apart, it is hard
We'd thought we were close but it still feels far
Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars
If we learn to forgive and accept who we are

If you play the part then I will play mine

Wait a minute, hold up a second
Don't leave me here with this feeling
Like I'm the one full of regret
Like I never did good for us both
Like you never did pull out that weapon
And stick that knife in my back
Was I supposed to accept it
When your words are like
More than just sticks and stones
Kinda like a bullet
A hollow tip that lodged in my bones
And I can't just swallow it
My pride is more than all that I own
So I gotta give it away
And some of the times I'm all the way wrong
But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along
To the song I write til I'm alone at night
And I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
Cause I know that me and you is just only right but one one one one...

It's a cry from the past, we have been through a lot
Every year has been great and a few have been tough
And your kids, they will reach for the stars up above
We'll sit and relax as we're cheering them on
The ropes to the light from the crib to the grave
We started alone, in the end we're okay

You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine

Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever

The Wonder Years,Passing Through a Screen Door,The Greatest Generation,3/27/2013,"Cigarette smoke dances back in the window
And I can see the haze on the dome light
I'm conjuring ghosts on a forty-hour ride home
And they keep asking me what I'm doing with my life
While my cousins go to bed with their wives
I'm feeling like I've fallen behind

Well, the highway won
I'm listening to traffic reports one on one
Coming quietly undone
I was born to run
Away from anything good
An escape artist's son
Sun-drenched pavement in my blood
The first thing that I do when I walk in
Is find a way out for when shit gets bad, and

I've been looking for
Tears in the screen door (Tears in the screen door)
I've been waiting for
Another disaster (Another disaster)

Well I'm terrified
Like a kid in the sixties
Staring at the sky
Waiting for the bomb to fall
And it's all a lie
What they say about stability
It scares me sometimes
The emptiness I see in my eyes
And all the kids' names I've ever liked
Are tied to tragedy
And I don't want my children growing up to be
Anything like me

I've been looking for
Tears in the screen door (Tears in the screen door)
I've been waiting for
Another disaster (Another disaster)
And I was kinda hoping you'd stay
I was kinda hoping you'd stay

I keep a flashlight
And a small knife
In the corner of my bed stand
I keep a flashlight
And the train times
But you wouldn't understand
How could you understand?
Jesus Christ, I'm twenty-six
All the people I graduated with
All have kids
All have wives
All have people who care if they come home at night
Well, Jesus Christ, did I fuck up?

I've been looking for
Tears in the screen door (Tears in the screen door)
I've been waiting for

I'll watch the summer sun set in my two hands
And I'll hold it there forever, forever my friends

Youth left us for dead

To make some sense of all the years we spent
Bearing the weight of our own expectations
Dreams built with bare hands
Did I do all that I could do with my time
How can we say that we were unprepared
I made the best of all the chances given
But we grew up too fast
That place that we once knew is gone
We left it there nothing but a hole in the ground
It wasn't where that we came from
It always felt like when that we called home
Those two years they made us who we are
They made us family and brought us this far
We ripped our skin so we can't shake it off
We march on and tell our story's by our scars

Cause one day you will wake and realised all you had was the chance to let it all go or stay true to your friends
But you slipped again
I can tell by your vacant expression that the years spent in your head haven't treated you kind
And what we all wouldn't give just to listen once more before the tape unwinds
It gets easier to just let go than watch everything you love slip through your hands
I guess it's better off as memories

And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind

Stood in line for so long just to picket
Something I will never understand
Aren't you tired of always being mad at the world?
Won't you just admit you don't care?
And lady, I don't want your pity
So don't feel sad for me
I got a love I would die for and a song to sing
Maybe we're both just living out our dream

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind

We get along for the most part
Me and reality, the light and the dark
We live alone, two different worlds
Me in a fantasy, you in your memories
But we get along
We get along (for the most part)
We get along (yeah, for the most part)
We get along (for the most part)
We get along
We get along, we get along

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind (leave you behind)
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind (leave you behind)

Some of us have to grow up sometimes (we grow up and never grow old)

Paramore,Hate To See Your Heart Break,Paramore,4/9/2013,"There is not a single word
In the whole world
That could describe the hurt
The dullest knife just sawing back and forth
And ripping through the softest skin there ever was

How were you to know?
Oh, how were you to know?

And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before

Love happens all the time
To people who aren't kind
And heroes who are blind
Expecting perfect scripted movie scenes
Who wants an awkward silent mystery?

How were you to know?
Well, how were you to know-oh-oh?

And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before

For all the air that's in your lungs
For all the joy that is to come
For all the things that you're alive to feel
Just let the pain remind you hearts can heal

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

Every night I try my best to dream
Tomorrow makes it better
Then I wake up to the cold reality
That not a thing has changed

But it will happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

And the salt in my wounds
Isn't burning any more than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood in these veins
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have
The only thing I know that's keeping me alive
Alive

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

It's just a spark

Aren't you gonna stay the night?

I pour my heart out to your voice mail
Let you know I caught a bus to your side of town
And now I'm standing at your doorstep
With Los Angeles behind me
If you don't answer I'll just use the key that I copied
Cause I really need to see you

If you're not here when I break in
I'm gonna go through your closet
Just so I can smell your skin
As the chemicals swim
I know I'll never love again
I swear I'll never love again

Of love and other simple things
Learning to forgive even when it wasn't a mistake

Making eyes at this husk around my heart
I see through you when we're sitting in the dark
So give me your filth
Make it rough
Let me, let me trash your love

I will sing to you every day
If it will take away the pain
Oh and I've heard you got it, got it so bad

On an answering machine
In a house that's always empty, so I know nobody's listening
I've been confessing my transgressions over tape hiss
The silence makes me sick
No good can come from this

I've been hanging on like poison ivy
Out of cold suburban concrete
From this careless urban sprawl
I'm letting go
You know we can't keep out of trouble
I thought my kids would call you uncle
I thought we'd never be alone

Well I got images
Of you inside my head
Outside of the gas station where we always used to shoplift
It's car-crash rhetoric
We fucked up everything we came in contact with
Just boyhood recklessness

Of snow angels and gut laughs
If you walked me home
But you won't, you're all alone
On some bullshit, pill-bottle vision quest
If you walked me home
Well, I don't know when I would finally
Work up the backbone
To walk alone

The Wonder Years,I Just Want to Sell Out My Funeral,The Greatest Generation,5/14/2013,"Clear the apartment
I plan on collapsing and I could have sworn I heard a car door slam
I'm stuck at the corner of grinding teeth and stomach acid
All alone under a soft rain and streetlamp
I spent my life weighed down by a stone heart
Drowning in irony and settling for anything
Somewhere down the line all the wiring went faulty
I'm scared shitless of failure and I'm staring out at where I wanna be

I just want to sell out my funeral
I just want to be enough for everyone
I just want to sell out my funeral
Know that I fought until the lights were gone

I'm walking through harbors and churchyards
I felt the snow crack under my feet
I'll stay thankful for mild winters, for every shot I got at anything
I'll blame the way that I was brought up or the flaws that I was born with
Or the mistakes that I've made
They're all just fucking excuses
So bury me in the memories of my friends and family
I just need to know that they were proud of me

I just want to sell out my funeral
I just want to be enough for everyone
I just want to sell out my funeral
Know that I fought until the lights were gone

And oh, we all wanna know
Where'd the American dream go?
Did you give up and go home?
Am I here alone?
And oh, when the credits roll
I'll watch as the screen glows
The moments when I choked, all the fears that I've outgrown
At least I hope so

I was just happy to be a contender
I was just aching for anything
And I used to have such steady hands
But now I can't keep them from shaking

Oh I'm sorry I...
I'm sorry I don't laugh at the right times
Is this what it feels like with my wings clipped?
I'm awkward and nervous
I'm awkward and nervous
I'm awkward and nervous
I'm awkward and nervous
I'm awkward and nervous

I was kind of hoping you'd stay
I was kind of hoping you'd stay
I need you to stay

I need you to stay
I need you to stay
I need you

No, I won't let him in

A Day to Remember,I Remember,Common Courtesy,10/8/2013,"I'd never wish any of this on anyone or anything
Aw come on, you gotta try and look at things like me
I never needed anything I got
I never keep anything I have, what do I have?
Mostly things that'll never last
Then I think back...

I remember when I first saw the country
I remember sleeping in the van
Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand
I remember jumping off of cliff tops
I remember playing with no one there
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been
Cause where I've been

They wonder why I hide myself from everyone
From everything, man come on
You wouldn't last a day as me
Everyone loves me for my past, but they always hate me in the present
Why can't you just meet me somewhere in the middle?
It's in the hardest times we grow the most

I remember when I first saw the country
I remember sleeping in the van
Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand
I remember jumping off of cliff tops
I remember playing with no one there
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been
Cause where I've been

Speeding up, to slow down
Side glances around this crowd all at me
There must be something I can't see, so tell me
Hold me up, help me out
As I circle around what makes me happy
There isn't one place that I can be without leaving
This is my life

I remember when I first saw the country
I remember sleeping in the van
Said goodbye to friends and family, cause they could never understand
They don't understand
They don't understand

I remember jumping off of cliff tops
I remember playing with no one there
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am
I remember the coast of California
I remember trucks stops cross the land
Never kept too many idols cause we were busy being them
I remember waking up in Georgia. I remember quitting my last job
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I was, where I've been

A Day to Remember,Life Lessons Learned The Hard Way,Common Courtesy,10/8/2013,"Life lessons learned the hard way

Four people waited in a random white unmarked van
Parked outside your hotel high rise garage
To use a tire iron to break the bones inside your legs
Too bad you never came outside, that's all right
Cause in the end you'll get wrecked
Yeah, in the end, you'll get wrecked

I heard a little girl killed herself today
That blood's on your hands (It's on your hands)
When everyone knows your face, nothing's safe
You'll live your life as a fucking target

You've earned my disgust

A Day to Remember,Right Back at it Again,Common Courtesy,10/8/2013,"We're? coming out swinging!

Started out in the spring of 2003
Never went to school, nobody talked to me
Except to tell me all the things I couldn't do
Don't want to hear about it
Got with my guys packed into all our cars
Hit all the nearest scenes, and every local bar
I played a show a night 'till it made me sick

So here I am, I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said, if you're too cool for school
You ain't here to make no friends
And? I said hey (hey)
I'm right back at it again
Just like I have always said, you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends

Left home with no kinda backup plan
And everyone one that we knew that we couldn't stand
Said ""If you can't? make it here, you won't make it there""
Don't want to hear about it
Spent most of our nights sleeping on hardwood floors
People's living rooms, in any open door
Played a show at night 'till it all made sense

Don't wanna hear about it
Don't wanna hear about it, yeah

So here I am, I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said, if you're too cool for school
You ain't here to make no friends
And I said hey!
I'm right back at it again
Just like you'll always say, you're too cool for school
I ain't? here to make no...

I'd give you everything but that would never be good enough and that's alright with me
You take me for granted. I tried to help you be who you wanna be
I'm a sucker for a complication
Here goes another week it must seem
You weren't worth my time, you weren't worth my time

Reserve my right to be afraid

Cast your stones, cast your judgment
You don't make me who I am
I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable
Reserve my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan

Deliberate and deep

Teach me, teach me not to dream
Dream deeply
I haven't left you for days
My panic keeps me awake
As he unwinds, inside
He told me I should have known
That he'd hated the way I'd grown
To love soft lies, she lied
Do you miss her like I missed you?

Last Friday night I wasn't me
I was a still life trapped in eternity
I was the focal point out of focus, out of ink

I don't wanna be an asshole anymore
Baby, baby, I'll be good to you

And plunged myself into the depths of oblivion
Yeah somewhere along the way I found wine
Feels damn good just to bleed sometimes
But all I ever wanted was to make things right
The years of idleness and spite
I push my emotions off a bridge
After taking them hostage with a shotgun
Now they're somewhere treading water
Somewhere lost inside the man that I'm not

I was at a mall in Norwich
Shoppers stared at the ground
The escalators went on smoke breaks

Maybe the future's just a little bit weird
Maybe the God you love is all I've got to fear

And then we drove back, drunk
Through the busy city streets

Every time I try to speak
In front of a big crowd
A pretty girl, or the police

And all the horrible things that you do

I was a runaway, somewhere in a grave of mistakes
Transient love, you should've seen the view from the mansion
It made me think of things we never mentioned
The things we're too afraid to say

Like what if I spend the next few years
Just somewhere in some atmosphere
While you're at home with bills to pay
I hope it doesn't end this way

Made it to the gate with record timing

That nobody would notice me or the boltcutters I was hiding
Underneath my oversized jacket
I snuck around the back and broke you out when the gods weren't looking
I was on my way to heaven when you died

They got us surrounded
They beat us with batons
Cuffed us and threw us in the car

I demand a fair and speedy trial

How do you make sure that something like this won't ever happen again?

She's always poking her head out
And striking a pose
I'm always plucking her petals
And some nights we fall out of love
Some nights I sleep in her arms
Some nights I sleep
Some nights I sleep on the couch

Well I spent that night in our past life
Wringing out the years from our shoes
In the distance you lived with my signature
Penned on a treaty that kept our armies at rest
But I was a pushy little one
When you tried to find someone new
I just kind of waited around for you
Because what else was I suppose to
What else was I supposed to do?

I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists

I saw it in your face the day we parked your car
On the shoulder by the reservoir
And in my mouth, my words did hide
For fear of being recognized

I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists

Lay on blankets bought
On a date the day before

Can't help but to glance
From the corner of my resentful eyes
Guess it's all perspective but
It's you I never get enough
We're always far apart

We've got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love
We've got a vicious love

When I go out alone
And see them sharing meals
Like Lady and the Tramp
Hate their loving eyes
Wishing it was you and I
Add tip to my receipt
Fold it up behind a picture of us
Guess it's all perspective but
Together though we rarely touch
Hard not to fall apart

We've got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love
We've got a vicious love

I could have given up a thousand times
In the past that was so easy
When the thought came to my mind
There was no convincing me
Plant my feet to face it all
Side by side or a phone call
Living in tension with you
Still feels better
Better than I've ever known

You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

I wish I'd known how much you loved me
I wish I cared enough to know
I'm sorry every song's about you
The torture of small talk with someone you used to love

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July",1

Just like Judy
The kind that makes June feel like September
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent

She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, ""Baby, come home"" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Did you ever love her?
Do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing, ""Baby, come home""
""Baby, come home""

I've got those jet pack blues
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me
Honey, don't you leave
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink
It never mattered what it was, I think
Our hands were just that close
The sweetness never lasts, you know

She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, ""Baby, come home"" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember
Baby, come home

Fall Out Boy,Novocaine,American Beauty/American Psycho,1/20/2015,"This is a black, black ski mask song
So put all of your anger on
In the truly gruesome do we trust
I will always land on you like a sucker punch

Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sang at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with Novocaine and now I'm just numb
Now I'm just numb
Don't mind me, I'm just the son of a gun
So don't stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I'm just numb
I don't feel a thing for you

I'm just a problem that doesn't want to be solved
So could you please hold your applause
Take this sideshow and all its freaks
And turn it into the silver screen dream

Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with Novocaine and now I'm just numb

I feel like a photo that's been overexposed

Looking back, I see a setting sun
And watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far, how we got this far

And the pastor's words come pouring down like rain
How he called you a sinner and said now you walk with Jesus
So the drugs that took your life aren't gonna cause you any pain
I don't think he even knew your name
And I refuse to kneel and pray
I won't remember you that way
I lit you a candle in every cathedral across Europe
And I hope you know you're still my patron saint
I tried to forgive, but I can't forget the cigar in his fist
I know that they were heartsick, but I need someone to blame
And I know how they blamed me
I know what you'd say
You'd tell me it was your fault
I should put all my arrows away
I'm sure there ain't a heaven
But that don't mean I don't like to picture you there
I'll bet you're bumming cigarettes off saints
And I'm sure you're still singing
But I'll bet that you're still just a bit out of key
That crooked smile pushing words across your teeth
Cause you were heat lightning
Yeah, you were a storm that never rolled in
You were the northern lights in a southern town
A caustic fleeting thing
I'll bury your memories in the garden
And watch them grow with the flowers in spring
I'll keep you with me
These wolves in their suits and ties
Saying, ""Kid, you can trust me""
Charming southern drawl, sunken eyes
Buying good will in hotel lobbies
Buy fistfuls of pills to make sure you don't hurt no more
You don't gotta feel anything
Got their fangs in our veins
Got their voice in our head
Got our arms in their grips
No, we can't shake free
This goddamn machine, hungry and heartless

Turning purple in the cold
From a night at Shore Memorial
I was sixteen and afraid
Turned away
Like I'm working babyface
Out of Mid-South in the eighties
I kept a blade hidden in my wrist tape

I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight 'til my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
I think enough is enough
Hidden in the tall grass
In the naked light of day
Put my past self in the ground
I've been dancing on the grave
I'm not the person that I was then
I'm tearing him away
I was bitter, I was careless
I was nineteen and afraid
But you deserve more from me
I don't know why I would say those things
But you deserve more than me
And I'm trying every day

I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up

You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You were the baby teeth I buried
You were the sounds of distant cars
You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You were the banner that says ""no one""
That I tattooed across my heart
You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You scattered like ashes across every song that I write
You're where the light pollution starts

I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks

I'm laying on my back on the roof
Gonna shoot these clouds full of holes
I need some fucking light to pour through
Cause December's got me up against the ropes
And I don't know how to get loose
I can't get feeling back in my toes
From walking in circles with you
Like we're lost Canadian geese
I should be south of here already

I'll be your dead bird, you'll be my bloodhound
You're just doing what you're told
Pick my body off the ground
I'll be your dead bird...

I'm staring at Hemingway's shotgun
And I'll picture him drinking alone
He's forgetting things that he wouldn't have before
His eyes are starting to go
And I heard all about how his plane went down
After Christmas in the Congo
Read about his own death in the paper
I bet it was freeing to know
When you destroy everything worth chasing
There's no where left to go

I'll be your dead bird, you'll be my bloodhound
You're just doing what you're told
Pick my body off the ground
I'll be your dead bird
Hanging from your mouth
You're doing like you're told
Gonna make your master proud
It's good to know
I didn't die for nothing

December's got me backed into a corner again
My ears are back, my teeth are showing
I'm combing through the wreckage trying to find where I've been
I still get phantom pains but from a safer distance

I'll be your dead bird, you'll be my bloodhound

Pick my body off the ground

Where I go through the windshield but I don't fix it

She told everybody
How she knew she would die soon before she did
I hear her cry on ""Faded Love""
The air in August here's heavy with salt and smoke and stings my lungs
My airbag light's been on for weeks
And I can feel it mock me
It's bittersweet like laughter through crooked teeth
I want to move so far from everything
That they could hear my heart beat
And then break as I lay dying in the street
They'll think the ice cracked at the lake
They'll think a tire blew out and a car crashed on the interstate

It's hard to watch you walk away
These aren't the vultures that were circling just yesterday
It's hard to watch you walk away

Picking at bones, at what's left of your misery
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
So when my vocal chords rip
So when my knees give in
So when I bury all of this
Who's gonna give a shit
If I'm breathing?

American broken promises

You made purple out of camellias

We charged headfirst into the woods with bows and arrows drawn
Crudely fashioned-- sticks and rubber bands and spray paint
We swore ourselves protectors from all the evil in the world

John Wayne with a God complex
Tells me to buy a gun
Like shooting a teenage kid is gonna solve any problems
Like it's an arms race
Like death don't mean nothing
To know the heavy price of living poor
Walled in by red lines, backed into a corner
Not knowing growing up what it's like to belong here in America

If everyone's built the same then how come building's so fucking hard for you?
It's something we're all born into
Nothing's left up to gray
It's black or white and sometimes black and blue
It's something we're all born into, whoa-oh
Now I know what's in a name
Not just my father
Three-fifths a man makes half of me
Why should I bother?
Merchants of misery stacking the deck
Fuck your John Waynes
Fuck your God complex
I have everything in front of me
But can't reach far enough
To touch those fever dreams
They call American
I am the ghetto's chosen one
The privileged bastard son

They're gathering rope
You push into heaven all alone

You used to burn bright

Put out the light
In your clouded eyes
Kept you inside
Through the summer time
You put up a fight, pressing flowers at night
In a book that you love
The pieces they can't take of us
I found you shaking at the lake
A hospital bracelet still tight to your wrist
We talked to fill the empty space
Danced on the ice until it breaks
They flooded a town so this park could exist
You see us walking on the streets in your dreams
The pills that they fed you
Your half awake eyes
The bluest things on Earth don't know shit about the blues
You used to burn...

Put out the light
In your clouded eyes
Kept you inside
Through the summer time
You put up a fight, pressing flowers at night
In a book that you love
The pieces they can't take of us

Put out the light
In your clouded eyes
Kept you inside
Through the summer time
You put up a fight, pressing flowers at night

The Wonder Years,You in January,No Closer to Heaven,9/4/2015,"Goddamn, you look holy
Hit from behind with light
You're a painting of a saint
And I'm nervous, stumbling over my lines
When I tell you I love you
And we stare at Catalina
A city lost to the sea
Carried out by the tides
You were the one thing I got right
Goddamn, you look holy bathed in the January light
On the floor of our new bedroom
On the carpet with the window open wide
When you tell me you love me
I can actually see it
Your breath frozen in the air
Newborn droplets of ice
You were the one thing I got right

I'm measuring heartbeats in miles away
You held me together
I used to burst and decay
We got off the airplane
A couple of runaways
I was hoping you'd stay
Could you stay?
You were the obvious one
(From a taxi cab in Chelsea
Out past Salvation Mountain)
You were the obvious one
(From a walk along the highline
Out to Wicker Park in August)
You were the obvious one
(From your Upper East Side dorm room
To the South West Marin Headlands
With you smiling in the sand
Goddamn, I hate leaving)
Another early flight
I ran the dishwasher this morning
I wanted there to be clean plates for you tonight
I've grown used to your perfume
It hangs in the morning light
Wake me up before you leave for work
Kiss me goodbye
You were the one thing I got right

I'm measuring heartbeats in miles away
You held me together
I used to burst and decay

The ones where you don't know me
If I could get this right
If I could get away from the old me

Right now I'm dying just to breathe in
Just to be alive
Just to get away from the old me

So we makeshift love tonight
There's a triage in my living room
She checks my vital signs
Then opens up my wounds

Like I'm dying tonight
And the whole world is laughing
Like everyone I love is gone away
Whoaaa
I'm dying tonight
But no one is crying
It's not alright no matter what they say
Whoaaa

I fuckin' hate these fights
The ones where you just own me
We used to be so tight (yeah right)
But you just want the old me
Turn off the god damn lights (turn off the god damn lights)
If you're really gonna get up and just leave
I used to get so high
Cause that was just the fuckin' old me

There's only makeshift love tonight
There's a triage in my living room
She'll check my vital signs
To see what else she can do

Like I'm dying tonight
And the whole world is laughing
Like everyone I love is gone away
Whoaaa
I'm dying tonight
But no one is crying
It's not alright no matter what they say
Whoaaa

All that she wanted was me broken hearted
I know it's sad but it's true
I won't get her started now she's departed
There's no looking back me and you

There's only makeshift love tonight
There's a triage in my living room
She'll check my vital signs

West side Humboldt 7am
Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
With the radio on and a new black eye
Because I bet you couldn't knock me out
And I guess you really got me now
Black Sedan ran a red light
Just a drunken bike messenger on Tuesday night

Fell on to the table as the neighbors just stared
We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
Digging with our hands in the dirt outside
And she dragged me to the edge of town
And she slapped me, then she pulled me down
I can do bad and you can do better
Spending all night getting lost together

I wish I could remember

I'd never heard before
You've done so much for me
And I love you
But I don't like you anymore

Someone lock the door
I don't like me anymore

I don't like me anymore

Was it something that I've done?
Was it something that I've said?
Was I having too much fun?
Did I dropkick someone's head?
I turn on the TV
And I don't like what I see
There's an old punk rocker acting like a jerk
And that jerk looks a lot like me

Someone lock the door
I don't like me anymore
And here comes media whore
I heard this story twice before

Hit the lights and drop the curtain
Organize a mob and rush the door

Peel me off the floor

A burning open sore
I don't like me anymore

Then ask for something more
The never-ending story
A filibustering bore
A pompous dinosaur

Feel like anybody's whore

Forget about the way it felt before

Try to breathe the air that's here and now
Try to find some peace in falling out

We don't have to say goodbye
But we can't get lost in time
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Maybe in another life

You tell me there must be a little light left flickering
Burning in a place we set afire
But no one will listen if we just wait here to burn
We gotta swing away, gotta cut the wire

Try to breathe the air that's here and now
Try to find some peace in falling out

We don't have to say goodbye
But we can't get lost in time
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Maybe in another life
We don't have to say goodbye

I'll be yours and you'll be mine

I'll be yours and you'll be mine",28

Cancel my parade
The street is empty tonight, tonight
Everything is quiet now
The city holds its breath for me
Their spirit has died, it died

Running my whole life to reach this place
And just when I arrive, the moment fades out
Will you let me?

Stop time
Your hand in mine
Bring me closer as it all gets ripped away
And I say goodbye to the clearest eyes
I won't be with you
But I won't be far away

I don't need an answer
But if you rewrote the past
Do you think you'd just leave me out, leave me out?
Or will you spin your head around in every crowded room
To see if I can be found, be found?

Every single plan you will forget
So do what makes you happy
No regrets now
I won't let you

Stop time
Your hand in mine
Bring me closer as it all gets ripped away
And I say goodbye to the clearest eyes
I won't be with you

And then I heard you say you'd wait around
I won't let you

Bring me closer as it all gets ripped away
And I say goodbye to the clearest eyes

When you said, ""nothing's new""

NOFX,Bye Bye Biopsy Girl,First Ditch Effort,10/7/2016,"It came back negative and gave us a scare
The next year it grew back again and you started to swear
And after chemotherapy, you threw up and lost all your hair
And when I said bye bye biopsy girl
You acted like I didn't care
I took you to the Mission, you could order pollo
I took you to Chinatown, you said, 'Let's take it to go'
But when I asked you to take it Greek and ATM with French
I had to say bye bye bilingual girl
You said no and knew the consequence
And when I called La Migra and the INS
They took away your documents
You took me to the Jamesons and said, 'Swingin' is fun'
You told me I was good in bed, but you wanted to be with more than one
And when you said your friend was hot and I could go all the way
I had to say bye bye bisexual girl
I didn't know your friend was gay
I had to say bye bye bisexual girl
When he said I had to pay",54
NOFX,California Drought,First Ditch Effort,10/7/2016,"I once heard a song about it never rains in Southern California
I once saw a band play at the Farm sober I hadn't had a drink
Like cleaning gums or huggin' bums
Or doin' something that you know's good for ya
Those times are tedious and tenuous
And hopefully much shorter than a blink
I'm so easy to deciphe, I could rationalize for life
But from all the strife I caused, I gotta go without
Taking codones is insane, I don't wanna kill I want more pain
So like the California drought, I'm dryin' out
I got the one job that it's frowned upon if you're not a user
The bands that are all sober are the ones playing the Warped and county fairs
I'll go to an alcoholics meeting and get booed and called a loser
Then I get invited to a party from a bro who works at Bayer
He's got the shit from 1910, bottled H that's genuine
I just wanna see what all the hype's about
I just gotta try it once, but I say no cuz I got 3 months?
And like the California drought, I'm dryin' out
My sponsor should be Ernie Ball or PBR not Pat from Petaluma
The chips I want are kale, corn, potato, and for betting on a flush
But now I gotta listen to a 20 minute story that's just a rumor
And I'm sorry but this nicotine and caffeine don't gimme the same rush
I'm a jest pilot in jux, to positions in a crux
I'm not in fashion I'm in flux, so they all doubt
I just want some cocaine but it's making me insane
I think I may have broken my brain so I'm dryin' out",54
NOFX,Dead Beat Mom,First Ditch Effort,10/7/2016,"She's a dead beat mom, a one woman pogrom
A tri-polar paradigm, a lunatika time bomb
When everything is alright, she makes everything wrong
Living only to spite and spit napalm, she's a dead beat mom
She's a dead beat mom, she's a dead beat mom
She's a dead beat mom, a storm without a calm
VPA and Lithium is what she should be on
An emotional vacuum, a good vibe tampon
She got her degree in poisonous pedagogy
A course taught by her mom
Someone stop her before she destroys
The childhoods of my two boys
My sons mean everything to me
So I pray for some agency to tell her that she's wrong
But the Dead Beat Mom isn't able to hack it
She needs to be in a Prada straight jacket
A padded rubber room is where she belong
It's a perfect place for, maybe add some mace for
The Dead Beat Mom, she's my Vietnam
I got PTSD and an STD
Is everything ok?
NO EVERYTHING IS WRONG
Last week I saw her humming this song

It comes from thickness and 30 year begrudgement
You end up sighing it's only STD

NOFX,Generation Z,First Ditch Effort,10/7/2016,"I think that our kids will probably see the end of humanity
As we know it, cause this world's about to blow it
Will they see what they saw in ancient Rome
The destruction of the home?
Will they see the end of civility?
Cause when morality's been blurred, procreation seems absurd
And human rights and freedom are just words
That have lost all their meaning
In a world that is bleating like an animal at slaughter
I hope that my daughters never know what it feels like to give up
To know the whole world is corrupt
To realize that they are really on their own
And there's no one left who cares about the future
Infected cuts don't need a suture
There's a feeling that the human race has seen the checkered flag
And the laps that are given are the last ones ever driven
And everyone who's still living knows that
It's a shame that the Earth will live on but can't give birth
To a baby planet where we could start over again
We've been divided, we've been bled
Like a chicken without a head, running frantically amok
Taking but not giving a fuck
History is just an alibi
It's believing every lie man has ever dared to write
It's so much easier to see than complex reality
A lifetime full of misery and blight
So we tell our daughter's and sons that they're not the final ones
To see this planet as a decent place to live
We use a telescope to give them faith to give them hope
Anything to help them cope with their future
Cause there's no alternative
Kings and queens ruled the land
There's more and more lines drawn in the sand
Pawns are crooks castles are rooks
It's too bad the good books
Written for the sub-classes to introduce morality
Had nothing to do with reality
But then again who would have ever read them
We read the Par Quran for lunch
Eat Old Testaments for a snack
And read the Lulla-bible before bed
There's no more points of view
(It's sad I'm gonna see)
When your only thought is food
The bible has been replaced with a survival guide
(The end of history)
That uses perishables instead of parables
Because there's no stories left to preach
(We don't wanna be)
There's no large lessons left to teach anyone
Why bother?
(The Generation Z)
Who are we
Are we the intellects, or the insects?
(We don't wanna see)
We're not the ones who will ever know the answer
It's impossible for us to imagine what is right in front of us
(A species you and me)
I guess that's what makes us think we're human
But being human only lets us see a little farther than animals
(The end of history)
Feel depression from spending most of your life working?
(The Generation Z)
Try chemicals
Chemicals make everything better!
(The end of history)
Hate, love, morality
(The Generation Z)
They're just chemical reactions

Are we just chemically imbalanced ants
On chemically fueled rants?
It really just comes down to sex and power
I bet the last man standing
The last human on this planet
The last person on the earth
Doesn't give a shit
Or have any idea that he or most likely she
Is the last one
The last person on this planet will fuck the dead
And die thinking not about why didn't anyone care
But why her life was so unfair
It's time, it needs to be said

But man and womankind has unfortunately been pronounced dead",54

NOFX,I'm A Transvest-lite,First Ditch Effort,10/7/2016,"I first heard Frank say, he wanted to dress like Fay Wray
I wanted that too but what could I do in junior high school in L.A
My heart skipped in the scene, he said you gotta be it, not just dream
It was a taboo I knew I wouldn't pursue, I didn't have the self esteem
I gotta confess that I like to cross dress
And I've been doing it since I was 13
It's hard to tell bros that you wear women's clothes
Even in the 'open minded' punk scene
You'd probably get hurt in heels and a skirt
When you're in the middle of a circle pit
So I'd only wear panties under boxers to keep it all a secret
Now I'm telling everyone cuz it's fun and I don't give a shit
Forward 30 years, I still had the same fears
Then I saw Hedwig play a Bilgewaters gig
And I felt the same envy and tears
I decided right there, I can't be bothered to care
What other people think, I'm gonna dye my pubes pink
And throw out all my Hanes underwear
I'm not transgender, I'm a lazy crossdresser
Who thinks make up is too much of an ordeal
I paint my toes and wear shiny tight clothes
Not for the look but how it makes me feel
I don't need things just right, I'm a tranvest-lite
I only shave to do the Time Warp midnight Saturday
I'm done with self-pity, I don't have to feel shitty
Cuz I wanna look pretty so I give it the old city college try
Don't get me wrong, I still wanna be a guy
Who sometimes likes to dress like a girl
He sometimes likes to wear diamonds and pearls
Don't think I don't know I'm not foolin' anyone
He's a cross between Adele and Charlie Chaplin
You know it's not just girls who just wanna have fun!",54

I never heard a bad word about him
I never heard a bad melody
His dying isn't tragic, it's a fucking catastrophe
I've lost my parents and so many friends I chalk it, c'est la vie
It's nothing like losing my friend Tony
Sometimes on weekends when our kids hang out together
Kiera tells Darla that her dad's songs are better
And I think she's sad, cuz tomorrow she hopes her dad
Will be coming home, cuz he told her that 3 years ago on the phone
Tony, you make me see myself in a way I don't wanna see
Do I have to stop living so wrecklessly?
So I can be the father I know I can be
All the endless nights we had, the 20 years of laughs
I've looked but I can't find any photographs of us
Because it's weird to take photos with your best friends
Cuz you don't think that you'll never see them again
I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you
When you needed me in the end
I was there to give your eulogy
But not when you needed a friend
When they lowered your body into the ground

We're at a one way dead end cul-de-sac
I hit rock bottom but it didn't hit back
I gotta say this really ain't so bad
It's a funny thing, it's never lonely
I really can't complain cuz it feels like home to me
Tell me to quit and talking shit about
I really gotta say, this bottom ain't so bad
I got a demon juggernaut from battles I already fought
I put the cog in cognition, I'll sign my last resignation
There is a neon sign and a wooden plaque, they say:
You've hit the bottom, we knew you'd be back

I know the reason
I can't stop touching my eyes

I'm allied to the night and warring the morning
I retreat into the dark if someone is near
You can lay me right out with the right kind of flower
When my senses slip away lilies appear

In the hot house you'll find me
Staring at the end, again, in rapture

Beauty, how you blind!
Give me a reason
Without sight
I will ever find you
And how you blind!
I know the reason
I can't stop

I lick my fingers
(Lick my fingers)
Make my tongue go numb
(Make my tongue go numb)
I chew you from beneath my nails
(Make my tongue go numb)
Put your petals in my mouth
Put your petals in my mouth

Beauty, how you blind!
Give me a reason
Without sight
I will ever find you
And how you blind!
I know the reason
I can't stop touching my eyes",5

I need you to tell me

Does it make it worse?

Laughter in the darkness
Whispers in the shadows
I was there when the wall fell down
I'll be there when the ocean rises
Building castles of cans and bottles
Drinking like they do in novels
Know they'll catch me by and by
But tonight you are my alibi

Same old sun that we all come from
Faded stars in the air that we breathe
In the earth, in the sea

You used to call me darling

And wonder how long it would take to walk to
But now that's like the distance between me and you

Somewhere light years from the world you used to know
Like a lock that doesn't turn
Like a plant that doesn't grow

Over the Walt Whitman Bridge back to Philly

I toss and turn at four in the morning
Petrified of where our future's going
'Cause you're the kind of girl that deserves the world
I'm just the kind of guy that promises the world
So I fix a drink nice and strong in the kitchen
Something quick that'll cure my conscience
Creep back to bed and I kiss your forehead
Maybe everything is fine and it's all in my head

Your wild years that you often mention
The sands of time in an hourglass
That you're always begging for back

With your father in the living room

Blink-182,8-Jun,California,4/27/2017,"You live in a world I cannot believe
You create a world I don't want to see
And your forest's a stand of dead trees lost in the night
Did you ever think you'd live down the past
You just want to tie yourself to the mast
All your nightmares have come to at last
At least in your mind

Learn to swim in rushing rivers
Breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm

This shitty guitar needs some personality
This shitty song needs some personality

Your hollow accusations no one ever hears
Your wounded senses of pride, a guilty souvenir
All your protests and vacant excuses ring insincere
(This song needs some fucking personality)
I just want to find a car to overturn
I just want to light a fire to watch it burn
Now we're past the point of no return and no one is here

Learn to swim in rushing rivers
Breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm

This song needs some fucking personality
Anybody? Somebody?
Give me some fucking personality!
What happened to personality?

You are afraid
Uneducated on where this would lead
Going on for far too long
We are sorry for the greed
Leave us in pieces and places
War-torn and wronged
In between whispers and screams
You permeate my soul
Lost between nightmares and dreams
You decimate this home

Learn to swim in rushing rivers
Breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm

How about I disappoint them more?
I am a disappointment!

A twenty dollar bill

The first to give advice
Played it up like I was noble
But I was feeding my own pride
The lengths I'd go for a fix
Tacky charm got me far
Must have hurt so many feelings
While stabbing my own heart

I felt it was leading to a continued
 I hope this is helpful for you.
When I wrote this letter I felt I may have been finally able to address how it feels

Another brick-red room, another black-top town
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
Another star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray
Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
Another song that runs too long, God knows no one needs
More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot! dance
Beneath another burning sky, behind our painted lips
In scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships
So throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
As protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me
When this repetition ends behind the window shades
A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made
That most unrestful bed, that most original of sins
And you'll say that's what I get when I let ambitions win again
I'd hate to let you down so I'll let the waters rise
And drown my dull reflection in the naive expectation in your eyes
Back in a cast bit-part, back when I felt most free
I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me
So before the regiment resumes, before the dreaded sun appears
My driver's waiting, so let's make one point crystal clear:
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You see a flood-lit form
I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine

I see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realising that what they see may not be even close to the image I see in myself
And I hate I might actually be more afraid
 I feel like they know the story
I saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
Twelve years ago I stood on the shore
Jump in and grab the coat
And the river is rushing toward a waterfall
And my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
I let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me
In any case please let me know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful",6
Paramore,Pool,After Laughter,5/12/2017,"As if the first cut wasn't deep enough
I dove in again 'cause I'm not into giving up
Could've gotten the same rush from any lover's touch
But why get used to something new?
'Cause no one breaks my heart like you

When you kiss me, I wish we could see what happens next
For a moment, I could forget what happens in my head
If I doubt you, would you come through?
Happy second chance or happy ending
But this time you don't leave me sinking

(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
I went further out to see what else was left of us
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
Drain the fantasy of you
Headfirst into shallow pools

And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
The illusion, can shatter before we begin
If you're really sorry
Happy second chance, think I could forgive
This time you won't leave me sinking

(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

There's a little child with a million ways to feel
Caught up in a hurricane
Paper thin walls
Angry words from down the hall
Something changed them
I think about him every now and again

Now there's a ghost in the back of this room
And I don't like it
I fall asleep with my covers pulled up
And try to fight it
I gotta say it's hard to be brave
When you're alone in the dark
I told myself that I wouldn't be scared
But I'm still having nightmares
(I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake)
(I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake)
I'm still having nightmares
(I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm still having nightmares)

Every little thing got me coming back around
Digging up old memories
Always used to be the one to let it go
Kept my fears in a suitcase
I locked them away
In a place they wouldn't find
They still haunt me
I think about it every now and again

Now there's a ghost in the back of this room
And I don't like it
I fall asleep with my covers pulled up
And try to fight it
I gotta say it's hard to be brave
When you're alone in the dark
I told myself that I wouldn't be scared
But I'm still having nightmares
(I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake)
I'm still having nightmares
(I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm still having nightmares
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake)

Distinguished in the way that you are spoken
Whiskey on your breath
Patches on your vest

Rancid,Buddy,Trouble Maker,6/9/2017,"I get nostalgic every time I think about you
Like the time we took the BART train to San Francisco just for the view
And the rain came down like fire
And the fire messed the ocean tide
And the moon sang a melody
Well, it shined down on you
I get by in time, well, 'cause we're here for a very short run
And hold the gate 'cause we're comin'
There'll be room for everyone
By the time that train was leavin'
We were stranded at the end of the line
And the moon sang a melody
Well, it shined down on you
Tangled up and troubled
Man, life ain't an easy road
You see, there's always time to get in trouble
And you will always make it back home
Well, the life starts on San Pablo
And I walked up to Albany Hill
And the moon sang a melody
Well, it shined down on you
And the moon sang a melody that shined down on...you!
You know that it's true!
Shined down on you
It's true!
Shined down on you
Take it, Lars!",23

The Wonder Years,Flowers Where Your Face Should Be,Sister Cities,4/6/2018,"Bright blue hydrangeas
Lost in the weeds
Bus stops and barbed wire on the way to stare
At the heart of the earth from the Poas peak
Just like the ones that we grew back in Jersey
Hung upside down, drying out for the wedding

There's a man with his head in his hands on the sidewalk
His wife's there behind him just off of the street
She scratches his back as he sobs on the asphalt
And what strikes me most is the symmetry
How they're framed just like you and me
When the light from the hospital's eastern wing
Tangles up in your hair and the sadness that pooled in my heart
Starts emptying slowly

Well I saw you last night in my dream
And there were hydrangeas where your face should be

The redwoods feel lonely and lunar and distant
The sun comes in fragments through breaks in the trees
And I feel further from home than I've ever been
These thin lines of light across space tether you to me
They pull in my memories, back to our apartment on 2nd Street
Through the South-facing window the light catches lengths of your hair
Like a path that you left me

Well I saw you last night in my dream
But there were azaleas where your face should be

Pieces of us in the morning sun
Sleeping bags under the 101
She takes off his glasses as he falls asleep again
They don't got much but goddamn they got love

Sad and sober, Sunday afternoon
You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon
Sad and sober, Sunday afternoon
You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon

I watched parts of you dissolve
Turn to ash and then get carried up
I watched your memory fade
Shadows burned into the wall
And no, I felt my lungs turn into atom bombs
Choke on the Florida heat until the oxygen's gone

Stormed outside, I became a believer
And telekinesis in your rambling thesis
The leaves on the trees, they were whispering

Don't wanna fall asleep
Go on and call the police
Turn us in, we're the freaks
Yeah, we're Adam and Eve
In the garden, we'll start over
We'll get it right",NA
Saves the Day,29,9,10/26/2018,"Heartbeat, heard it in my heartbeat
Pounding in my head in the blue-black night
Heartbeat, hypnotize me
Stuck just like a song in my head
Before the first thought I ever have
Heartbeat, blue skies
Heard it in your blue skies
Singing in the air in the morning light
Blue skies mesmerize me
Laughing like a clock on the wall
Before the first song I ever heard
Blue skies, radio
Hear it on the radio
Playing in the car with the windows down
Radio electrifies me
Louder than the Liberty Bell
Before the first word I ever said
Radio


Put the record on, blow the speaker up
Tear the dial off, push the pedal down
Ninety-nine on the one-oh-one
Flip it over, come on, sing along

So in love with your music (so in love)
So in love with your music (so in love)
So in love with your music (so in love)
So in love

We oughtta head home, we're gonna turn around
Turn up the radio, get lost inside the sound
If they're playing all our favorite songs
Then we're driving all night long

So in love with your music (so in love)
So in love with your music (so in love)
So in love with your music (so in love)
So in love

Gonna stay awake another thousand years
You better buckle up in your electric chair
Shock my nerves, send lightning to my  brain
Light me up and live again

We were driving in my mother's car
Chicago-Minnesota overnight
Over the frozen overpass over black ice

Before and after
What if it had never happened?
Before and after
No way to know what's gonna happen

Cop shades up, hiding my eyes
In La Crosse for seven nights
Out of touch and out of sight
Broken wing and fractured mind

Before and after
What if it had never happened?
Before and after
No way to know what's gonna happen

Still seems strange, water, wine, and X-rays
White pills for pain and faces change in days
I saw you from above, upside down
There in the corner of our hotel room
The door was open, 432

Walked out on a spine three years later with you
Got lost in the Badlands, took a picture or two
Now I wish you were here to share the view
But you're gone

Before and after
What if it had never happened?
Before and after
No way to know what's gonna happen

Still seems strange, water, wine, and X-rays
White pills for pain and faces change in days
I saw you from above, upside down
There in the corner in our hotel room
The door was open, 432


Wrote you nineteen messages
And I can see you didn't read them
So I'll say it again
Got my phone in my hand and it's 3 AM
Gonna drive all night 'til the highway ends
I know you'll say I'm on the edge
And if you're not so wrong
Could you lend a hand?

Come on, come on, come on
Please pick up the phone

Tangerine pink cassette tapes
And stacks of compact discs I saved
Laughing and pointing, you narrow your eyes
Turning all of my friends into your allies
Might have been born in a crossfire hurricane
But don't think twice, it wasn't yesterday

Come on, come on, come on
Please pick up the phone
Come on, come on, come on
Please pick up the

Wonder if I'm ever gonna see your call
But you already know I loved you all along
And it's all in the past and I can't forget
'Cause I still hear your voice echo in my head
At your parents' house on Leap Year Day
At the surprise party you planned for me
We're outside walking to your door
You're laughing in moonlight

Come on, come on, come on
Please pick up the phone
Come on, come on, come on
Please pick up the phone


If I could take back all the things I wish I never said
I wish I never felt the way I did the day you left
I was a stupid kid, twenty-something
Watching myself sing on TV
No way to know that there's
No way to know what to expect
Suddenly it's as if it's almost overnight success
Somehow lightning in a bottle ricochets
Lights a spark underground

And on the corner of Victorian & 21st
On Halloween, I step outside and see you standing
There the light is shining, smiling in your green eyes
Like starlight through diamonds

When I met you, I was on my own
Twenty-two, living alone
Wasted on the cover of a magazine
Singing from my heart, sad love song
Stranger from the start, what went wrong?
And then there you are and it's getting better
Without you, I was lost forever

On an endless night, on an endless drive
I read your words about a thousand times
Saying things like there's a lazy moon outside
Right now, can you see it laying on its side?
I wake up way too early, stay up way too late
Trying to picture your face
Please send a polaroid, get it that Saturday
Your yellow envelope I still have to this day

I was a sideways zig-zag, upside down
Stuck tongue-tied, crisscrossed X's
Where my eyes once were and the light that was gone
Before I met you, somehow came back on

When I met you, I was on my own
Twenty-two, living alone
Wasted on the cover of a magazine
Singing from my heart, sad love song
Stranger from the start, what went wrong?
And then there you are and it's getting better
Without you, I was lost forever

Singing from my heart, sad love song
Stranger from the start, what went wrong?
And then there you are and it's getting better
Without you, I was lost forever

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Maybe someday I can show you
How much you mean to me
Even though I know you see
My smiling eyes begin to stream
A love wells up inside me
Almost too much to take
Sometimes I break down crying
That's how much you mean to me

You're the light in a heartbroken world
And I was a lost cause
Before you, I almost forgot
What the point was
In the end, if it's all just a dream
At least we're together
If I'm with you, I could stay lost forever

And if I were barely breathing
I'd still confess my love
Even when I see you clearly hope
I catch on quick and stop
If my zipped lips were sewn shut
Collar up, I'd keep it cool
The light in my heart beaming
Shining brighter than the sun

You're the light in a heartbroken world
And I was a lost cause
Before you, I almost forgot
What the point was
In the end, if it's all just a dream
At least we're together
If I'm with you, I could stay lost forever

There was a time before this
Back when we were young
I still remember how
You brought me back to life again
I looked in your blue-green eyes
You're looking back at me
My heart explodes in sunlight
You mean everything to me

You're the light in a heartbroken world
And I was a lost cause
Before you, I almost forgot
What the point was
In the end, if it's all just a dream
At least we're together
If I'm with you, I could stay lost forever

If I'm with you, I could stay lost forever
If I'm with you, I could stay lost forever


I was just a Jersey kid born in a daydream
Blue skies and a white gold sun down a long driveway
In an old white house, I remember my dad walk up
His eyes shining like clear blue streams
And when he smiled at me
I knew everything would be okay

Well, somehow (somehow), sometime (sometime)
I know it'll be all right, we are alive in the world

Back when you could see the Milky Way
In blue starlight, in an ocean sky
I could've laid there for a thousand years
Connecting dots in a ring of fire
Drawing circles that hang in the air
Like fireworks and diamond stars
In her mother's arms, her sapphire eyes
Was all the love I'd ever need

Well, somehow (somehow), sometime (sometime)
I know it'll be all right, we are alive in the world

Yeah, somehow (somehow), sometime (sometime)

Emptied for the art walk while the missions close
Pop-up tent cities abounding
Birthing scant displaced humanity
As we diversify
We spill from cities
Beyond the wealth crest
Traditional boundaries
Everything meant to burn. Thirty-year cycles
Mud pots, sandstone bluffs, crumble and erode
Fault lines, fortitude
Small streets swell into grand avenues
As we devalue
Debtors of the dream
Living oblivion
Skin-deep sun-seeking
Life in the construct that's sold
Promised land, golden state, sunny, blissful
No longer affordable

Forget  everything that we've ever known

And  I got kidnapped by a pirate nation

A mirage of the life that we had before

The grief starts when bumping into friends turned acquaintances
We stumble around the small talk
We break the silence with Jameson
But once we were inseparable
We were the only punks in town
We spent every weekend raisin' hell in the basement of your parents house

Farewell youth, I'm afraid I hardly got to know you

Always in a rush, but I was never sure from what

Another auld lang syne to your bullpen
More vacancies my friends
Let's do this!
Cracks in wet asphalt
Stress fractures cave-in to craters
Structural downfall
Leaking life
Dad is a failure
Everything in this sinking building broke
The bread-and-butter choke
Oh no
Jini Jini, I lost my head
Can't pay the rent, can't mend the fence
The life we built in the home we made
Where ownership it means nothing
If we leave, we will never be able
To return from landlock
We could breathe within our means
Stable for the long-term trade-off
It's only a version of you
With a distorted world view
The fear of the unknown
Imprisons you
Jini Jini, I lost my head
Can't mend the fence, can't pay the rent
The life we built in the home we made
Where ownership it means nothing
Ownership means nothing
Our ownership, it means nothing",NA
Lagwagon,Parable,Railer,10/4/2019,"Where do we begin
Wonder is a sin
A dog that we name dogma
The cat we won't forgive
We'd go outside to play
But it's not safe today
Brother's eyes watering urge
Grown-ups sigh imaginary words
But they would not desert me
They would not desert me
They will never hurt me
We will run away
And find our safe place
Somewhere to stay
Animal, order of control
The last sapien in rule
Implement the plan inherited
Indoctrination fails you
The clan will fall
Oh, imposed identities
Oh, your viewpoint narrowing
Oh, to shed formality
Oh oh oh, the leap from certainty
Start a fire, abruptly we conspire
Subdividing just as soon
Uncontrolled, the flash-mob uncontrolled
A flash-fire briefly fueled by rage or wrath
Oh, reality now dull
Oh, the image more beautiful
Oh, the scandal society of ritual truth burning
They will not desert me
They will not desert me
They would never hurt me
We will run away
And find our safer place
Somewhere",NA
Lagwagon,Pray for Them,Railer,10/4/2019,"Our thoughts and prayers extinguish flame
They  won't go on suffering
Our  hopes disclaim, alleviate our pain
And in his name we are proud to be ordained
We won't accept cognitive dissonance
We  deeply care but we are powerless from here
We  pray for them
We pray for them
We  pray for them
The barrier protects us from defeat
Shelter from the clash of evidence and old beliefs
Our hopes and fears, respectively inane
And  in his name we are certain to be saved
We will not bear existential grief
We'll never be powerless without relief
God of the gaps accounting
Faith and denial compounding
Throw your hands up in the air
And pray for them
Pray for them
Pray for them
We pray for them
We pray for them
We pray for them
We pray for them
We pray for them
We pray for them",NA
Lagwagon,Stealing Light,Railer,10/4/2019,"What's another word for fuck?
Sound to incite, tone to give up
Everything we are in tenor drift
No more than air and spit
Machines that move in entitlement
Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Maybe next year
Can you cite which one's abused?
Those without choice, those in costume
Identity of the afflicted mind
They want their name on that sign
Longing to be oppressed
Stealing light
Isn't it sick?
Isn't it lit?
Unlike the opportunist
Victim aligned
Finally verified
We're still alive
Oh, to stamp out the meek
Our common enemy
Off with their heads
Off with their heads
Off with their heads
Our words are all the evidence we need
Off with their heads
Off with their heads
Off with their heads
With chosen marks we deviate, transformed
Off with their heads
Off with their heads
Off with their heads
As if these marks resemble those inborn",NA
Lagwagon,The Suffering,Railer,10/4/2019,"""The world is full of magical things, patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper
Those who have never known the deep intimacy and the intense companionship of happy mutual love have missed the best thing that life has to give
Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.""
All our lives in fast pursuit
Smash and grab like thieves
Posterity. What will you leave behind?
Consigned
Life, a humbling disease
Believe
Devoted road, the places you will go
All the people you will know
Crossroads
Resolve your actions and your deeds
Echo for eternity
Foresee
Want for contact, need for insight
The unbearable pity for the suffering
How do you express yourself?
How do you tell the truth?
Surrounding you, the darkest points of view
Suffer
In their toxic feedback loop
Hostage
Devoted road, the places I've travelled
All of the people I have known
High roads
Full of doubt and certain of nothing
Concede
How humbling my life has been
Begin
Want connection, hunt for knowledge
The unbearable lacking for the suffering
It's not unusual to lose hope
It's common to become unhinged
I'm giving in, I'm giving in
Let it begin. The suffering",NA
A Day to Remember,Resentment,You're Welcome,11/22/2019,"Resentment

I need a short term fix for a long term problem
Can I learn to love these chains?
I know I had a point but now I forgot it
While I'm circlin' the drain

No, I can't stop feelin' like every day's exactly the same
With a one track mind I don't think I can change
Trapped in memories stuck on replay, replay, replay

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high-wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up
Resentment

You know I lost my voice when I let the rot in
Hard truth cuts both ways
Pourin' out my heart
All that's unforgiven
Washing over me like rain

No, I can't stop feeling like every day's exactly the same
With a one track mind I don't think I can change
Trapped in memories stuck on replay, replay, replay

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high-wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up
Resentment

I've got this chip on my shoulder
So I press the issues on sight
For all who need introduction
Welcome to the eye of the tiger
Go

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high-wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up
Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high-wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up

It's a wildfire
It's a wildfire
Resentment
It's a wildfire
It's a wildfire
