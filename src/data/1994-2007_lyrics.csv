Lifetime,Isae Aldy Beausoleil,Tinnitus,01/01/1994,"I want to be the cutest boy in the world, I want to make everybody love me
I'm in a kickass band, we have lots of fans(lots of fans!)
Now you tell me that I'm gonna have to justify what I'm thinking and what I'm feeling, I don't need your money to know I'm right
I don't need you to subsidize my fight
Because I'm feeling quite Isae Beausoliel, tonight
All my life it's been driven into my skull
Be successful, be happy, be beautiful. All my life it's been driven into my skull and you wonder why I'm such an asshole"
Lifetime,Starsixtynine,Tinnitus,01/01/1994,"Sometimes it feels right but mostly less than said
You feel the right to ask ""are you depressed again?""
Sometimes and even though I smile I'd rather feel like shit
I'm sure you know just what I mean"
Lagwagon,Island Of Shame,Trashed,01/04/1994,"And it's prejudice
As if he chose to be this way
They'll make him keep more than he would take
One summer morning
He left us ashamed
In some small town of small ways
The one they feared
They might turn to stone
They feared to hold his hand
And he died alone
He died alone
They might turn to stone... alone
Don't leave them on an island of shame
Your solution
You homophobic
You coward
You send them away to an island of misery
You're not immune to any disease
I can not argue when the truth is plain to see
In your beliefs, your fear of death
I see reflections of society
We'll take our last breath alone
Don't leave them on an island of shame
Open your eyes
It's all in sight
Adding insult to injury
'Cause deep inside
The truth in lies
It's not that blind
He was alone
And it's prejudice
As if he chose to be this way
They'll make him keep more than he would take
It's prejudice
Yes it's prejudice
As if he chose to be this way
They'll make him keep more than he would take
They like to stabb him in the back"
Lagwagon,Know It All,Trashed,01/04/1994,"Look at the world in disbelief
You used to follow; now you lead
College has enlightened you
And you are proud to be different
And like different bands, different types
You ain't nobody's fool

It's like certain bands remind you of someone you hated
Cause they didn't wear the right clothing
And there's only one true fashion
And a lot of the bands on the college charts are great bands
Until they get signed; then you hate them
It's such bullshit
You used to love them, you hypocrite!

Know it all
Know it all
Did you really listen to that song?
Could you ever write what you call wrong?

I remember you and I
Listening to bands that we liked
Only the songs mattered to you
But now you're a DJ and preaching that hype
""Coporate Rock Sucks,"" you know
""College Radio Enlightens You.""

It's supposed to serve as a means to expose new bands without prejudice
But it makes no sense
""Safe Harbor for the Underground""
'Til the alternative becomes the popular sound
The bands are good 'til they make enough cash to eat food
And get a pad, then ""they sold out""
And ""their music's cliche,""
Because talent's exclusive to bands without pay!

Know it all
Know it all
Did you really listen to that song?
Could you ever write what you call wrong?
Know it all!"
Green Day,Burnout,Dookie,02/01/1994,"I declare I don't care no more
I'm burning up and out and growing bored
In my smoked out boring room
My hair is shagging in my eyes
Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight
To drive along these shit town lights

I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
To walk amongst the dead

Apathy has rained on me
Now I'm feeling like a soggy dream
So close to drowning but I don't mind
I've lived inside this mental cave
Throw my emotions in the grave
Hell, who needs them anyway

I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
To walk amongst the dead
I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
To walk amongst the dead
Dead


I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
To walk amongst the dead
I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
To walk amongst the dead

Green Day,Coming Clean,Dookie,02/01/1994,"Seventeen and strung out on confusion
Trapped inside a roll of disillusion

Well, mom and dad'll never understand

Secrets collecting dust but never forget
Skeletons come to life in my closet
I've found out what it takes to be a man
Well, mom and dad'll never understand
What's happening to me

Seventeen and coming clean for the first time
I finally figured out myself for the first time

Green Day,F.O.D,Dookie,02/01/1994,"Something's on my mind
It's been for quite some time
This time I'm on to you
So where's the other face?
The face I heard before
Your head trip's boring me

Let's nuke the bridge we torched two thousand times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say

Stuck down in a rut of dis-logic and smut
A side of you well hid
When it's all said and done, it's real and it's been fun
But was it all real fun?

Let's nuke the bridge we torched two thousand times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say
To say

You're just
A fuck
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck
I'm taking pride
In telling you to fuck off and die

I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say
I'm taking pleasure in announcing this to you
So listen up 'cause you might miss

Green Day,Having a Blast,Dookie,02/01/1994,"I'm taking all you down with me
Explosives duct taped to my spine
Nothing's gonna change my mind
I won't listen to anyone's last words
There's nothing left for you to say
Soon you'll be dead anyway

No one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've meant
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing

I'm losing all my happiness
The happiness you pinned on me
Loneliness still comforts me
My anger dwells inside of me
I'm taking it all out on you
And all the shit you put me through

Well no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've meant
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing

Do you ever think back to another time?
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
And mow down any bullshit that confronts you?
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head?
To make one problem that adds up to nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing"
Green Day,Longview,Dookie,02/01/1994,"I sit around and watch the tube, but nothin's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fuckin' lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit

Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell
And I lost the key

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit

I got no motivation
Where is my motivation?
No time for motivation
Smoking my inspiration

I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun
You're fucking lonely

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And loneliness has to suffice

Bite my lip and close my eyes
I'm slipping away to paradise
Some say quit or I'll go blind
But it's just a myth"
Lagwagon,Bye For Now,Trashed,02/04/1994,"- You're not forgetting about tonight, are you? I left your name on the door and everything
- There are not gonna be too many punks?
- John would you stop worrying about the punks? They're just a bunch of kids with growing pangs, and they'll probably be doctors and lawyers someday

I fear to see the day
My friends all mate and move away
Will I grow up inside?
Won't ever happen to me
The city sights
The business types
I can see them, where are you?

Bye for now
I didn't mean to let you down
I didn't mean to drive you away
Bye for now
Now that you're not around
So many things I'd like to say

I see you and I think
Have I found the missing link
The piece that holds us together
If I had my way
I'd hear you say that it's okay
Friendship should last forever

Bye for now
I didn't mean to let you down
I didn't mean to drive you away
Bye for now
Now that you're not around
So many things I'd like to say
I didn't mean to let you down
Never meant to let you down
I didn't mean to let you down"
Lagwagon,Stokin' The Neighbors,Trashed,02/04/1994,"Friday night's a perfect night to mow some neighbor's lawn
And i'm drunk and at the helm before too long
And chris will gladly ride shotgun
'cause navigating seems like fun
Drunk and out of gas, we drive around and crash
Drivin' through the yard
There's nothin' u can do
Dave's behind the wheel and he's had more than just a few
Suburban families slumber in civility
Awakened to the sights and sounds of the yard they're blowin' down
In their death machine
Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
Dave's a midnight landscaper and he's workin over-time
And he is full throttle-- full throttle tonight
--ARIGHT!!--
He was almost home, just one more block
He had to hit that last mailbox
Dumped it in a ditch-- ain't that a bitch?
STOKIN' THE NEIGHBORS!
Dave had to run, dave had to bail
He was havin' too much fun to spend the night in jail
Had no triple A for a tow truck
Called 'em anyway only to hear them say
""hey pal, you're fucked""
""hey man, what're ya doin?""
""i'm goin for another drive, you wanna go chris?""
""ya bro, lemme grab a couple beers!""
""shouldn't be drivin like that, dave""
Dave's a decent guy like most of us until he drinks
Then his liquid mind takes over how he thinks
And then all that matters is havin' fun
Pulling off the next beer run
On one too many nights, the party's over
Drivin' through the yard
There's nothin' u can do
Dave's behind the wheel and he's had more than just a few
Suburban families slumber in civility
Awakened to aftermath, the neighbors have been stoked

Botte on the nightstand
I count disasters on my free hand now
Run for cover there's a big one coming
You'll be lucky if you're at ground zero
No one said that this life was easy
Did that no one ever live a life this hard?
It gets hard, the bills are scattered in the yard
Ashtray monument
A life spent waiting in cement comes down
After all, it's not that bad
I still have pictures, I look back
At all the things that we once did
You said ""I love you"" I guess you did

Thinking they might sing to me
But they just stared back
Broken, trainless, and black as night
Climbed out on to my roof
So I'd be a poet in the night
Beat the walls off my room
I saw the big room that is this life

This is my condition:
Naked and hysterical
Reaching to grab a hand that I just slapped back at
This is my condition:
Desperate, alone, without an excuse
I try to explain
Christ, what's the use?

Read and I felt so small
Some words keep speaking when you close the book
Drank and just about smiled
Then I remembered us in that bed
Put my ear to the door
I just heard hot rods and gunshots and sirens
People kill me these days
There's keys in their eyes but they locked from the inside

This is my condition:
Naked and hysterical
Reaching to grab a hand that I just slapped back at
This is my condition:
Desperate, alone, without an excuse
I try to explain
Christ, what's the use?

Boxcars in that little alley which is so much like the alleys of

Spectacles bought in some West Virginia or Florida or Liverpool

All about your disapproval
Still I remember the way I used to move you
I wrote you a letter
I heard it just upset you
Why don't you tell me?
How can I do this better?

Are you out there?
Do you hear me?
Can I call you?
Do you still hate me?
Are we talking?
Are we fighting?
Is it over?
Are we writing?

We're getting older but we're acting younger
We should be smarter
It seems we're getting dumber
I have a picture of you and me in Brooklyn
On a porch, it was raining
Hey, I remember that day

What the thoughtless are thinking
I am more concerned with what we're drinking

They'll laugh about it at the warehouse
Saying I'm so lame
It wrote itself
You can keep the blame

It'll be a happy song
Not unlike some other ones
While everyone's depressed and broke
I get high off your sick jokes
(Ha ha ha)

They're colossal
They're tousling
All the worried hair
Stay up there

So crazy, it just might work
Then we'll quit our jobs
We could be the next group that you rob

There are times for being dumb
This must be one of them
I'd like to know what's so wrong with a stupid, happy song?

It says many things in its nothingness
It gives me space to think, I guess
To think less and less

Moving units and tracking charts
Will they ever learn?
It isn't who you know, it's who you burn

It means nothing
Selling kids to other kids
If you think we changed our tune, I hope we did"

If I had a choice don't you think I'd make it?
I lost my voice, I hope I didn't break it
Little demons by my bed whisper secrets
The kind you never hear

I dip my toe in this cold, cold life
I want to dive but I can't find your feet
You with a view so unlike my own
I'm trying on your eyes
So I let go, fall to the ground
It's a long way down again

Petty cons keep peeling back my ears
We make plans
Collaborate and give to you my better half
Until now just dead weight, a prisoner of doubt
In a cell, we kiss and tell all our keepsakes

I dip my toe in this cold, cold life
I want to dive but I can't find your feet
You with a view so unlike my own
I'm trying on your eyes
So I let go, fall to the ground

You were from Oakland by way of the Midwest
I bought a rose and a suit with the pants pegged

You said, ""I smelled you twice today.""
Someone was passing out somewhere
We kissed a shot of Kentucky straight
I swore this life is worth the wait

Hayes broke the scissors, apologized
Our kitchen was crowded and steamy
Isn't it always?

You bit my neck blue

And put our faith in a closed door

Would anyone change it anyhow

Walls are shaking and they're closing in
Too fast or a bit too slow
Paranoid of people and it's starting to show
One guy that I can't shake
Over my shoulder is a big mistake

Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kind of weak
Saying all I know is
I gotta get away from me

I tell you, something just ain't right
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight
Avoiding my friends 'cause they all bug
Life is like a riddle and I'm really stumped
If you reason, don't you know
Your own preoccupation is where you'll go
Being followed, I look around
It's only my shadow creeping on the ground

Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kind of weak
Saying all I know is

I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
I'm just stoned

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
I'm just stoned"
The Offspring,Self Esteem,Smash,12/22/1994,"La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert
Now I know I'm being used
That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem

Oh hey yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

We make plans to go out at night
I wait 'til two, then I turn out the light
This rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up, I just might tell her so

Oh hey yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah

Now I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem

Oh hey yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease

NOFX,Drugs Are Good,45 or 46 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go On Our Other Records,01/01/1995,"Want to fuck up, drop out
Never trust a fucking hippie
And for that matter don't trust anyone
Quit school, don't work
Livin' out the music de punk
If I could do it so could anyone
Drugs are good
They let you do things that you know you not should
And when you do 'em people think that you're cool
Want to join a punk band
Shave your head and get a tattoo
You don't need talent just sing out of tune
Self-destruction
No moral to throw it on me
For no particular reason beat up everyone
Drugs are neat, and you can buy 'em relatively cheap
And when you do 'em people think that you're cool"
Green Day,When I Come Around,Dookie,01/31/1995,"I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone
And it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment
Sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user
So I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down
Because I know you're right

So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt
Means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around"
Blink-182,Carousel,Cheshire Cat,02/17/1995,"I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel
Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitude's a reason to die

Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?
I guess it's just another
I guess it's just another
I guess it's just another night alone

Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile
A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again

Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?
I guess it's just another

I guess it's just another night alone

Green Day,She,Dookie,05/05/1995,"She, she screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
Waiting for a sign
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

She, she's figured out
All her doubts were someone else's point of view
Waking up this time
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you"
MxPx,Tomorrow's Another Day,Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo,06/16/1995,"I don't want to let my life fly by
Do you ever stop, stop to wonder why?
And time flies by when everything is okay
It just turns out that life ain't that way
Big decisions overwhelm me
And I know nothing's free
When I don't think of, think about much
People die and we don't know why
I could use some understanding
Human contact, sign that contract

I don't want to let my life fly by
Did you ever stop to wonder why?
Ever stop to wonder, wonder why?
And time stands still when no one understands you
When you don't quite understand yourself
But just know this that God is faithful
Even if you don't have faith yourself
There's nothing quite like being sure of
Whats inside your heart
It's mostly simple but not so easy
To know just where to start

I don't want to let my life fly by
Did you ever stop to wonder why?
Ever stop to wonder wonder why?
Today didn't have to be this way
Tomorrow is another day
Another chance to make things right
A chance to make sense of last night
Today didn't have to be this way
Tomorrow is another day
Another chance to make things right
A chance to fully live your life
Only you don't want to, You don't want to, You don't want to, You don't want to
You don't want to, You don't want to, You don't want to, You don't want to
You don't want to, You don't want to"

So what's it gonna take? there's no getting thru to you
So what's it gonna take?
There's no getting thru to you
I'm way to young
To have a point of view
This whole thing just bums me out, Jesus knows my heart
But you don't care you've already made up you mind
I try to change my attitude but it's really hard
I'm so sick of you, God is gonna pull thru"

It consumes you can't you see that sin hates everybody
Everybody, sin hates everybody
Even though i know the reasons why, it breaks me down i want to cry
I search for comfort in a friend, when will my troubles ever end?

Tastes do good how could you know
Its deciteful lies
And where you're gonna go"
MxPx,Teenage Politics,Teenage Politics,07/04/1995,"No i'm not mad but i think they forget
What it's like and how hard it is to be a teenager
This is a new day and age, we read a different book
Where elvis ain't the rage and polyester ain't the look
And will we change at all when we get old?
Or will we be the same? never do what were told
Well that depends on you, are you doing the right thing?
It's not about control, it's about you and me and understanding

Teenage politics it's too confusing
Politics shmolitics it's too confusing
Is it time again to disagree
About anything, everything and what's on tv
It's a vicious circle, never ending
A linear equation worldy extending

Teenage politics it's too confusing
Politics shmolitics it's too confusing
No ill never be like you ill never ever be like you
Oh no! i'm just like you!"
Rancid,As Wicked,...And Out Come the Wolves,08/22/1995,"I saw an old man on the street

He moved so slow like a dyin' dream
Like a machinist who got caught in the machine
I saw this lady and she was cryin'
She said it's hard when someone you love is dyin'
I saw this kid who was about 5 years old
He was in the park all alone, he was cold

She's all haggard she's only twenty-five
She said she never had a friend before
I said, ""Hey girl, I'll be your friend, but who's keepin' score?""
I saw this other little girl on the phone
Her mother comforts her, far far from home
The little girl's very hesitant
Her best friend lie dead on the pavement
There's something coming around
As wicked as it may seem
As wicked as anything could be
As wicked as it may seem
As wicked as anything could be
I always end up back on the hill
Lookin' down at the landfill
I always go there when I can

New generation standing, stand with anger in their eyes
No love in the city 'cause there's no connection
Been stricken with disease, a racial infection

I'm a battering ram comin' through to you

Well an eye for an eye, yeah a tooth for a tooth
Brother against brother, should be singin' with the group
The inner cities burnin', yeah it's screamin' black and blue

Pits the dogs against the cats, now who is responsible?

Jackyl was one of the one's that perished

Through all this evil and wreckage, yeah
He maintained a sense of himself, yeah

Some men are in prison even though
They walk the streets at night
Other men who got the lock down
Are free as a bird in flight

How about the hour

In a one-way line

Beat lock him knock him take him away his authority
Hit 'em, ship 'em, club 'em submitted conformity

You know I started drinkin'
You know I don't remember too much of that day
Somethin' struck me funny when we ran out of money
Where do you go now when you're only 15?

With the music execution and the talk of revolution
It bleeds in me and it goes...

Give 'em the boot the roots the radicals
Give 'em the boot you know I'm a radical
Give 'em the boot the roots the reggae on my stereo

The radio was playin' Desmond Dekker was singin'
On the 43 bus as we climb up the hill
Nothin' incoming but the reggae drummin'
And we all come from unloving homes
(I said) ""Why even bother"" and I pick up the bottle
Mr. bus driver please let these people on
Rude girl Carol was a mini-skirt girl
My blurry vision saw nothin' wrong

Empowered impassioned by every move
It's so cold outside we need a place to hide
Go to? the club to thaw out for the night
She's automatic, so automatic
The way that she moves, the way that she moves
She's automatic, so automatic
The way she moves
Situations get tricky I was feeling so proud
The bass and the drums the music so loud
She asked me if I would stand at her side
Like glue that I would till the end of the night
My head was spinnin' a million miles an hour
The chance I was takin' I get anxious around her
She put her head on my shoulder I started to hold her
Swingin' and swayin' the morning begun
I say the way she moves, yeah

I say the way she moves, yeah

Rancid,The 11th Hour,...And Out Come the Wolves,08/22/1995,"Hey little sister do you know what time it was
When you finally seen all your broken dreams
Come crashing down your door
They demand an answer and they demand it quick
Or the questions fade and the wasted days
Come crawling back for more
And I said, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?
It starts and ends with you
The face of isolation
Well that's one you recognize
When you can't get straight
It's a lonely place and
It's one you do despise
Boredom is for sale now
And the helplessness you feel
Is a wounded dove and the hawks are above
Blood splattered on a reel to reel
And I said, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?
It starts and ends with you
I was almost over, my world was almost gone
In a sudden rush I could almost touch
The things that I'd done wrong
My jungle's made of concrete
Through the silence I could feel
That my aim is true and I will walk on through
These mountains made of steel
And I say, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?
It starts and ends with you
Oh, it starts and ends with you
It starts and ends with you"

I learned your name without words
I used my eyes, not my hands

What's the closest you can come to an almost total wreck
And still walk away, all limbs intact?
And when I go, you'll be there
Crying out, begging me
I won't hear
I'll just go fast into this night on broken legs

A near miss or a close call?
I keep a room at the hospital
I scratch my accidents into the wall
I couldn't wait to breathe your breath
I cut in line, I bled to death
I got to you, there was nothing left

What's the meanest you can be to the one you claim to love
And still smile to your new found friends?
In the same confusing breath
You pull away and draw me in
I wanted you, you wanted more
I built this life and now it's mine

A near miss or a close call?
I keep a room at the hospital

Jawbreaker,"Bad Scene, Everyone's Fault",Dear You,09/12/1995,"I went to a party last night
What sick things I saw
Make-out sessions and bicycle messengers
Punks and art school dropouts
I ran into this guy I knew
But hadn't seen in years
We went into the neon kitchen
And stole a couple beers

He said his girl had dumped him
But was there with another guy
He said that he still liked her

All I could say was
""Why, why, oh why, oh why
Why is it always like this?
Either you're too mean or you're too nice.""
He said, ""I even cooked her breakfast.""

So we went into the living room
Someone was blasting Zeppelin
It sounded good
I felt ashamed
I knew every drum fill
Anyway, there she sat
Totally kissing this guy
They looked good
I mean like in love
Then I remembered my friend

He said, ""How could you do this?
You said that you needed your space
He's wearing the shirt that I gave you.""

Then she said, ""Why, why, oh why, oh why
Why are you always like this?
If I'm having fun then it's breaking your heart
Besides, you said I could have it.""
Then the cops showed up"
Jawbreaker,Basilica,Dear You,09/12/1995,"Sunken eyed best friend of mine
Why do you sit so still, still shaking?
Superhero sapped of all powers
I'll kneel beside you, watch you for hours
There's an angel on you
Leaning down to kiss your cheek
Feathers floating on air
This is my prayer for you

Steps of stone, morning bright blue
Stick of flame, a candle winks at you
In the pew, head down I'm crying
I think you have thoughts of dying
I'm eclipsing them now
Calling all allies down
I'm consumed by your eyes
Keep them open and full

It's raining in your room
Angel tears, bask sweet
Angel eyes on you
They love all that they see

Dewy palm, cemetery lawn
Walk alone in gardens of loss
You can't have a flower of stone
Never let this soil come between us
I'm asking you on a date for the rest of your life

It's raining in your room
Angel tears, bask sweet
Angel eyes on you
They love all that they see"

I can tell by your glare
I wouldn't touch you on a dare
Seven months to June
And even then, so what?
My mouth is open, my book is shut

My air guitar is out of tune
My stupid hair is so '82 to you
At least I don't fit in...

Corner me in
In Chemistry
It's all just simple math to me
Call me your names
Make them stick
I'll laugh until I am sick

Glad that that's all through
Got better friends than you
Just can't remember where I left them
I'll see you all in class
Not if I ditch first
Expect the best, accept the worst

Walk until your blush subsides
Drink beneath the 405 in the ivy
And think about that girl...

Two grades below
She pierced her nose way before it was cool
Some older guy with a motorbike
Picks her up after school

This school's a living hell
I work and don't get paid
I smoke a lot but can't get laid

Sit and stare, it's all we do
All my friends are broken, too
We're just waiting
Waiting to begin...

Jawbreaker,Fireman,Dear You,09/12/1995,"Dreamed I was a fireman
I just smoked and watched you burn
Dreamed I was an astronaut
I shot you down like a juggernaut
Dreamed we were still going out
Had that one a few times now
Woke up to find we were not
It's good to be awake

Dreamed I was a tidal wave
I ravaged your coast, there were no survivors
Dreamed I was your landlord
I showed your place when you had lovers
If I was a vampire
I wouldn't suck your blood
Then I dreamed I was you
The sweetest dream I have had

If you could hear
The dreams I've had, my dear
They would give you nightmares for a week
But you're not here
And I can never sleep
Come home so I can be a creep

Dreamed I was a dream
Stole you away, away in your sleep
Saved you from a fire
Gun for hire
Introduced you to a vampire
Wave crashed on the beach
We rolled around in its foamy grasp
Kissing in the chaos of a kelpy sea
Seems I couldn't save you from me

If you could hear
The dreams I've had, my dear
They would give you nightmares for a week
But you're not here
And I can never sleep
Come home so I can be a creep

Maybe I'm obsessive to think like this
Probably not impressing you
With my cheap tricks
Honey, it's depressing what
Depression does to some
I'll play the part for hours but
I know you'll never come

If you could hear
The dreams I've had, my dear
They would give you nightmares for a week
But you're not here
And I can never sleep
Come home so I can be a creep"
Jawbreaker,I Love You So Much It's Killing Us Both,Dear You,09/12/1995,"A week inside, I think I'm starting to show
I told myself to keep myself in line
Should we get married or just go on killing each other?
I don't think I hate you enough to commit you to me

Happy all the time
It's all we ever do
Steady in decline
It's all we ever do
I'm sorry but it's true

How can I save you when I couldn't save a dime?
I want to call you and tell you that I'm a fan
All my friends know better but I can't quite hear them
Still for the life of me I can't imagine our home

Good things, that's all I want
All I want for you
Hold me
Set me free
It's all I want from you
It's sad and it's so true

If you can't be the life of the party
You'll be the death of everyone
All I want is a life without parties
Want you as one

Watch this pot and it is sure to boil
Sometimes I catch myself thinking, ""Boy or a girl?""
Kiss me on the teeth
It's all that we can do
Punch me
Wake me up
This lullaby is blue
Lie and say we're through

If you can't be the life of the party
You'll be the death of everyone
All I want is a life without parties
Want you as one"
Jawbreaker,Jet Black,Dear You,09/12/1995,"""I tell you this because as an artist I think you'll understand.""

I'll be quiet to keep you quiet
Don't concern yourself with my slow dying
Through the vents I hear you sigh
I don't get too high these days
Your floor is my ceiling
Lights out, you can't come in

If you don't remind me, I won't forget you
If you don't ask, I won't upset you

I am jet black
I am stone cold
Jet black to the center
Funny like a funeral
I need you to bury me

White noise in black room dust
These hands long for one last touch
Hourglass all out of trust
I don't scratch so I won't itch
I don't reach so I won't miss
I taste our last kiss

If you don't remind me, I won't forget you
If you don't ask, I won't upset you

I am jet black
I am stone cold
Jet black to the center
Funny like a funeral
I need you to bury me

This is the cure: the same as the symptom
Simple and pure: break to keep fixing
Patiently nurse, patient and nurse
This is the part I wouldn't show you
The part where you say, ""I don't even know you.""
This is your cue
Be glad that it's through

I am jet black
I am stone cold
Jet black to the center
Funny like a funeral
I need you to bury me

""Sometimes when I'm driving on the road at night, I see two headlights coming toward me, fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion: the sound of shattering glass, the flames rising out of the flowing gasoline."""

Have sex a lot
A hostile climate clouds and sickens you
Two room condo, treeless cul-de-sac
A nun's dark habit
All arm, no follow through

As a favor to me
As a place to go
As a favor to me
Little stitch to sew

Loose leaf paper
At a loss for words
A can of dinner
Hard to get a rise
Hook up the Sega
Have sex alone
Stick a fork in a socket
Still it's no surprise

I think I'm coming unplugged
I just scratch and shrug
Itches in my teeth
As a favor to me

I can't watch you all the time
Much as I would like to
As I think I ought to
It's hard to argue for this life
Harder still without you
Don't make me survive you

Ripe fruit falls from the tree so bare
Dead in sunshine, decomposing there
Spoiled and keeping
Keeping tracks to pick
Fitful sleeping
Were you never sick?

Another mouth to feed
As a favor to me
As a need to need
As a favor to me

I can't watch you all the time
Much as I would like to
As I think I ought to
It's hard to argue for this life
Harder still without you
Don't make me survive you

Perhaps they're listening

I am spilled and poured
I am peeled and cored
I am hanging from the floor
Flicker like a freak through a sleepless week
In a black cell of forever
There's a point to this
A point I think I often miss
Oh clever, clever, where's your heart?
You can turn a phrase until it reads a million ways
It makes no sense but it's as good as it is sad
I am sad, elated
I am segregated
There's this stitching and it's itching
All my friends are dead
Asleep in distant beds
At least these enemies stay close
Take me to the pretty ones
I want to be a pretty one
Sign me to a nice girl so she can ruin me eternally
They offered me a million bucks
All I want's a steady fuck
Oh steady, steady, where were you?
Channel surf a sea of static
See the prize but you can't have it
There's something thankless in a wish fulfilled
I am thrilled and bored
I am unskilled, adored
All of both and none of one
I would kill for more
I haven't killed before
I could set this heart on stun
Take me to the pretty ones
I want to be original
Sign me to a nice girl so I can sing her something meaningful
In my perfect world I'd be signed to a nice girl
It would cost one million kisses"

The world is an oyster locked in a shell
You like the taste of it but can't take the smell

I dot my t's and cross my I's
Pretend that I can write
I haven't got a nice thing to say about anyone except the one
Who caught me staring, so I just walked away

No one likes to give themselves over to an empty bed
If you're gonna sleep like that
Then you might as well be dead
But you still want all the covers
And no hair tickling your face
You're so proud of your physique
But you still want your cake
I got it!

I'm passing these open windows
Passing these open windows
There is plenty to criticize
It gets so easy to narrow these eyes
But these eyes will stay wide
I will stay young
Young and dumb inside
I have just begun to forget my lines

One can become two
Two can pick and choose

I saw through your trap and into my own wrists
Saw we were through, red ribbons spill to blue
A sight to sore your eyes

Slow dance alone with no one to the sound of four hands clapping
Congratulations to you both, I hope somewhere you're happy
If there's a moral to this story then I wish you'd show me

Hair in the blood
Fly in the disappointment
Rubber, I'm glue
I'll write the book on you
It's sticking to my face

You need a little less than what you take for granted
This is the sip that's drinking back from you
Blacking out your eyes
You need a little more suppression of your appetites
This is your honeymoon, in separate rooms
It's neither sweet, nor bright

I got this dress I'm hiking it around this waste of laughter
Slow dance alone with no one to the sound of four hands clapping
Congratulations to you both, I hope somewhere you're happy
If there's a moral to this story then I wish you'd show me

I made a word to give this state a name, this game a guess
I call it ""sluttering"" it means as little as your little test
You are your worst revenge, your very means, they have no ends

They pretend to be so above it all
Or so they would have you think
I think no one thinks at all

You might show some interest
Your world looks good enough to eat
I see the ghost of a better world
Living in your disbelief in ghosts
Now everyone tells me they're crazy
Crazy people aren't so fucking boring
Wake me when you're through being cool
Cause I'm snoring and hoping
To see you beside yourself
Show me the raw stuff of youth
Would you do it for yourself?

Or for me
We both need a change
Your fear of normalcy is hardly strange

Let's be deliberate, 'cause it's obvious to me
Deliberately weird is pretty obvious

And blue only when I have the time"

Can it be my third winter here stuck in a small town
You rode your bike past dark window shades
Looked down from my roof and not hollered a thing
Can I be so sad and not so close to forgetting last snowfalls time?
Precurse seasons cold and come of age
Even cold nights can't shake dreaming trains, endless truck
This time it's not worth fighting

Or the effect It has on your career
Act like you want to act
Be what you want to be
Find out who you really are
And don't pay any attention to me"
Lifetime,Knives Bats New Tats,Hello Bastards,09/25/1995,"Ever get the feeling ideals can't take us where we need to go?
Sometimes I'd like to just maybe squash your head, but next time that i see you
I'll probably just smile and say hello
Next time that star shoots across the sky I'm gonna grab it and smash it under my feet
Who wants to be happy?
I'll sleep on the floor and I'll just lock my door
So Dave don't come and tell me ""turn down that shit you play""
I wonder what it would be like to be real deep and dark
Typical and boring yea that's me
If I made up the rules you would be not so close to me"

Keep your hands inside your pockets
And draw blank stares

Lagwagon,Black Eyes,Hoss,11/21/1995,"He knows no shame and takes no blame
This simpleton sees everything
He's only satisfied to point out other's mistakes
Never afraid to use his pride
His tradition is old
His faith a hand-me-down
The family
He wears them on his sleeve
Morale and values left under a christmas tree
Hisonce had the gift
This image in his grandparents eyes
No guns
No drugs
No rape
No end
His vacent soul is pale and blue
In empty gaze
His crow's feet are a vision of defeat
Sick an tired of the meaninglessness
The irrationale
He's desensitized
His every need and emotion
A cup half empty
But full of euphoria
His searching for the lightswith in the dark
To swith his routine
To find a reason
To find faith and piece of mind
When one to many beliefs die
It's though to see through these black eyes
Everyone forgives
Everyone forgets
Everyone is true
And noone here will lie to you
He knows the truth
He knows the truth
Here nothing's certain
Disregard what you've learned
To find faith in piece of mind
All of their gods died with his piece
I should know him that heathen's me"
Lagwagon,Bombs Away,Hoss,11/21/1995,"You've got a thing about being lame
You think you'll show us all your handicap is great
You've got a thing about being lost
You think with our concern you'll find yourself and
You'll never be forgotten
Your family never wanted this one with all of her flaws
She's trailing far behind
She's feeling incomplete
She has no will to win
Listening I live inside your room
And you punish me as though I punish you dumb
Before it's done I am saint will you tell me now I
Never could relate to how you've been forgotten
Your family never wanted this one with all of her flaws
But I wanna know was this deprivation of money or of love

This is the last time you will be denied girl
You want that world that they took away
Go pick up the pieces
Find inner strength cause I can't save you
Find the life you left in a box
The world you said has cut you off

Bombs await you
Bombs away now let them all fall down you carry the
Burden it fills you with regret you never finished that
Feeling incomplete you carry their baggage the guilt
That holds you down

Bombs away now cause life's been so hard
And so long that's why I'm writing you this song"
Lagwagon,Kids Don't Like To Share,Hoss,11/21/1995,"And now you're searching for that new messiah
It's your greatest passion
To set 'em up and knock 'em down
Put him on a pedistal, idolitrary
Wear that ring you're married
It all yours to their envy
Cause you hold a higher key of senses
They are drawn like magnets
To a genius it's confirmed
Set him up and knock him down
And your taste is so accountable
But this is no great loss
And sharing never was a choice
Burning on a cross
Gives your credit and a voice
Here to relay your beautiful ideals vicariously through them
And when he died too many
They are all pathetic
You dethrone your king
Without listening, without ever listening
Jesus Christ is realized
As he burns on your cross
This is no great loss
Another one will come
The wait is short, the search is brief
You find another faith
Another Clark Kent
Another Superman
Flashing in the pan
Taste is so accountable
But this is no great loss
Sharing never was a choice
He's burning on your cross
Gives you credit and a voice
Only here to relay your beautiful ideals vicariously through them
And now they're searching for that new messiah
Is their greatest passion
It's the latest fashion"
Lagwagon,Move The Car,Hoss,11/21/1995,"The story it grows older, the story is no story here
I never knew what it is, and there's no sign of it ending
As I am it and ought to be, they're telling me I am

Bowling race car driver, superficial hitman you're
On the list at every door, you don't bowl or race fast cars
Composition competition you drive
Just because I don't go, to the church where you reside
I might as well forget it, the nineties won't be back again
Until i'm forty-eight years old
I can be the hungry, as i eat my words again, appealing yet apalling
Rising to my falling, I'm going to extreme ends, I'm gagging on their scene

You shift, I'm the driver, over time in it's defense, I move their car
And for a moment it makes sense, but I fail them in the end
In the arms of old age, knowing only one to lose
Feeling nothing more to hide, consider life a forgery
As you?e gagging on your scene, admit to fraudulence
Driven to this thought, death is certain, faith is not

Composition competition you drive competition
Competition i? losing i fail it in the end"
Lagwagon,Name Dropping,Hoss,11/21/1995,"Cristy can't take all the pressure
Kevin hates the girls he dates

Derek beats up all his grilfriends
Jessie like to comb his hair
Hanacek is on the wagon, I tried not to speak today

You slip and fall they pick you up and throw you down again
I left them there and found them here
I was rarely smart enough to dodge the careless words
You find them everywhere it breaks you into two
Emily had sex with Joey
Chris is weird he must be gay
Everyone is smoking h and I tried not to laugh today
Every word you hear you repeat
Every word you repeat you change
Here's a quarter there's a phone, why don't you call someone who cares

I left them there and found them here, it breaks me into two"
Lagwagon,Razor Burn,Hoss,11/21/1995,"She broke up with me
Two days later...
I think she met Don Juan in Italy
She has a new man
I have a new mustache
Now all my friends are gonna call me mountain man
And everyone will think that I'm a stupid drifter
To walk the earth alone
I'll never shave again
On the night she left me
Facial hair grew miraculously
I dressed in black like Johnny Cash
And grew this beard of shame
I've heard it said she looks a lot like Sherilyn Fenn
And some times i'm mistaken for Billy Gibbons
Look like a wise man, but I'm an idiot
It's over
She left me
And she will soon forget me
She found out I was lame
I grew a beard of shame
Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
I am a new man
I have a beard of shame"
Lagwagon,Sick,Hoss,11/21/1995,"I've been living for years in question, some obsession
Was I less to live with no answers, as a life cried wolf
I'm ashamed to mention my anguish, but silence lies empty
If I say it again can I kill it, will you lend me your ears
Breathe in breathe out exhale, acting sweating
A broken smile provides them a view, projection is nothing new
Just once I would like them to feel it, suffer in my skin
For a moment stand in my shoes, filled with swelling blues
I keep this room, and this room keeps me, chained to my organs
I am quarantined, to a place that's dark, staring at three walls
The door is locked to them
Maybe now that they all know it, you'll find solace
As you're drowning in narcissism, or is it self-loathing
Cause you fought it all in your head boy, psychosomatic
They used to humor you now they pity you, and nothing's changed
I keep this room, and this room keeps me, chained to my organs
I am quarantined, to a place that's dark, staring at three walls
The door is locked behind me
If I say it again can I kill it
Because they're sick of my complaining and i am sick of being sick
Maybe these will cure you completely, chemicals deeply
Saviors until you're dependent, don't let them go to your head
I'm ashamed to mention my anguish, but silence lies empty, silence lies"
Lagwagon,Sleep,Hoss,11/21/1995,"Hi it's me, I'm bored again
All is well, I'm not insane
I've been drunk for seven days
Everything is fine
I made some friends and broke the ice
Then I ate some bread and cheese
Gained some weight to keep me warm
Everything's okay
It's me, delivering psychosis
Over the phone to you
I've colored your world blue
Ten thousand miles from you
I'm sinking all alone
Treading new waters
Where is my buoy?
The van smells like a dirty sock
Everyone has got the flu
I'd rather be just sick of you
I'd rather be asleep
It's me, delivering psychosis
Over the phone to you
I've colored your world blue
Ten thousand miles from you
I'm sinking all alone
Treading new waters
I'm missing my buoy
When I get home
The band will have it's first hit song
You and I will buy some rings
And a suburban home
I'll bring home the bacon bits
We'll make our parents grandparents
I'll take you out for breakfast at night
And then we'll go to sleep"
Lagwagon,Violins,Hoss,11/21/1995,"I am just another fool
And I have to keep telling myself
That I am just an hypocrite
And I have to keep calling you one
And I forgot to bite my tongue
As my assumption is the mother of all mistakes
So I assume the role
Open my mouth
And clumsy words escape

So why you want to be there
When you could be here
You are slipping away
I awake with your replacement
A bottle in my grasp
In a unfamiliar place
Because you put me out
The butt of a sick joke
Into this ashtray life
As you come and go
Cause I forgot to service you
And we broke down
And you can't live with my mistakes
Well I assume false grace
Open my arms
And grasp at something true

How are you
How have you been
Girl I miss you
Wanna see you again
How are you
Want to be there
When you could be here
Girl, you are slipping away
I bring out the worst in you
And you try to let me know
You bring out the worst in me
Anxiety, anxiety
I'm trying to let you go
You say I'm giving you the creeps
So I assume the role
Open my claws
And grasp for your heart

How are you
How have you been
Girl I miss you
Wanna see you again
Into you
Like a mortal stake
So vindictive
Your love's slipping away
Violins
Into this ashtray life
Violins
The butt of your sick joke
Violins
I'm trying hard to let you go

The Bouncing Souls,Lamar Vannoy,Maniacal Laughter,01/26/1996,"He was only 16 and he knew he wasn't like anyone else
Listening to his records in his room he knew
Something had to change somewhere or he would go insane
But when some years slipped by and he still felt the same
People and money came and went but the only thing that stayed the same
Were the feelings he felt when those records played
He drinks 'til he falls down
Oi oi oi oi, his name is Lamar Vannoy!
He's looking for something and
He's gonna find it
Oi oi oi oi
And his name is Lamar Vannoy!
Me and Lamar in NYC on the avenue
Talking about nothing much
With a bag of brew the New York wind
Will blow and he will wear his engineer boots
Motorcycle jacket black jeans nowhere to go
Nothing to do
So much has gone
Wrong and so much is bad but sharing
This music with Lamar there is so
Much we have
He drink's and think's
About a girl who lies
Oi oi oi oi and his name is Lamar Vannoy
He'll wake up and
Go to work with a swollen brain
Oi oi oi oi
And his name is Lamar Vannoy
He drinks 'til he falls down
Oi oi oi oi, his name is Lamar Vannoy!

He's gonna find it

There smiling at me with here blue eyes
And curly hair i couldn't wait till next week
To make the stop see her at the
Quick check paper drop
Every wedensday we'd count the papers
We'd have a laugh at the people in their suits
No one seemed to notice how she was different
But i did and i knew. Another wedensday came and it
Seemed it was right so i wrote her a note that i
Hoped she would like dear
Kiah would you like to go with me to the boardwalk
What fun it will be
We'll eat cotton candy and we'll get french
Fries with vinegar and get a
Plate of funnel cake then we'll go on the
Zipper look out on the ocean
And puke it all up all the people will scream
We can have a laugh what do
You say? that's what it said in the note
Another week went by
And she never called another week came and
She wished she had she just
Broke up with her fiance and things were kinda crazy
With her i said i understood, another week went by
And she never called but i thought
About the way she looked at me and said to myself maybe..
I pulled into the quick check at 6am to see the sun coming up
When i walked in Kiah wasn't there. The manager said
She quit she isn't here do you want me to
Help you count the papers?"
The Bouncing Souls,The Ballad Of Johnny X,Maniacal Laughter,01/26/1996,"Johnny says he's bound by only six strings to this world
Johnny says he keeps them always one turn out of tune
Johnny never listens to the kids that say
Johnny X ain't never done the right thing anyway
Johnny wears his leather like a crown of thorns
Johnny spends alot of time wishing he was never born
Johnny waits at Journal Square and tells himself again
Johnny you're the patron saint of spittin' in the wind
Johnny's got all the right scars but he'll never learn from them
Johnny's past is his guide but he can't remember where he's been
Johnny looks up through the steam of his caffine and says
""Life a train I barely caught just to find out I ain't got the fare""
I got my records of The King to keep me
The red red wine in the air is drifting
Four chords and the spite to use them
And just enough wisdom to ignore the truth"
Bad Religion,Punk Rock Song,The Gray Race,02/27/1996,"Have you been to the desert?
Have you walked with the dead?
There's a hundred thousand children being killed for their bread
And the figures don't lie, they speak of human disease
But we do what we want and we think what we please

Have you lived the experience?
Have you witnessed the plague?
People making babies, sometimes just to escape
In this land of competition, the compassion is gone
Yet, we ignore the needy and we keep pushing on
Keep pushing on...

This is just a punk rock song
Written for the people who can see something's wrong
Like ants in a colony we do our share
But there's so many other fuckin' insects out there
And this is just a punk rock song

Have you visited the quagmire?
Have you swam in the shit?
The party convention and the real politik
The faces always different, the rhetoric the same
But we swallow it all and we see nothing change
Nothing has changed...

Written for the people who can see something's wrong
Like workers in a factory we do our share
But there's so many other fuckin' robots out there
This is just a punk rock song

10 million dollars on a losing campaign
20 million starving and writhing in pain
Big, strong people, unwilling to give
Small in vision and perspective
One in five kids below the poverty line
One population runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time

This is just a punk rock song
Written for the people who can see something's wrong
Like ants in a colony we do our share

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own, here we go

My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine
My sense is dulled
Passed the point of delirium

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

I'm taking one step sideways
Leading with my crutch
Got a fucked up equilibrium
Count down from 9 to 5
Hooray! We're gonna die
Blessed into our extinction

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all

Since you were so nice
I wouldn't think twice
I'd give it all away for one more day with you
If ever there was a girl to be engaged to
That amazing girl would have to be you
Before we hung out
Don't know how I lived without
Your beautiful face - by God's amazing grace
Andrea, I say your name and all I can do is
Think about the way you smiled
And kinda sorta held my hand
Went out for coffee in what must have been the smallest town in Kentucky
Andrea, we walked together
Down the dirt road by the bridge
That we sat by each other
Talked about a few things
You looked at me I looked at you
Before you know, it's time to go!
Since you were so nice
I wouldn't think twice
I'd give it all away for one more day with you"

After your next class?
Do you care when I tell you
Step around that broken glass?
Can I see you after you get out of school?

Take a ride on my Vespa, I'll take you home
I'll climb up to your window and read you a poem
I know that you believe in the one true God above

It's been a long winded, long time
I wish I'd never met you
I wish I could forget you
And what you said
You're directing your complaints to me

I'm not always sick, but often tired
Sometimes I'm having fun or wired
I don't have someone to call my own
I'm not full of all the answers
I guess that I'm an o.k. dancer
I just want to be left alone"
MxPx,Sometimes You Have To Ask Yourself,Life in General,11/19/1996,"Never quite just knew how to get it through
The utilitarian sloganeerian minds
And its time to stand up and redefine the lines
Right now
Compartmentalizing, isn't realizing
Because it's not affecting change in the real world
So get on with your life and get over mine
There's only one world and there's many different tastes
So enjoy, don't employ your state
Common goals, communicate to contemplate
The way things are and why
Don't pawn the status quo problems off on the other guy
Your a celebrity in your own world
Catch phrases only catching cobb webs
Spiritualized capital gain and wealth
Isn't the means to the end, isn't the end itself
Manifest individually
Manifest a sense of reality
Because it's non exclusive
Don't be so elusively blind
Things are never what they seem
You don't know what you'll find
Right now!"
MxPx,Your Problem My Emergency,Life in General,11/19/1996,"Get a clue, I'm not here for you
I'm not like you
I'm not gonna do what you say is right
'Cause then I'll end up just like you
I'm gonna rebel, I'm gonna fight
This organized manipulation
Learn to think before you speak
And you just might make a point
I'm just an average guy, is that hard to accept?
I live a normal life I've got no regrets
Don't make me out to be something that I'm not
I never said I was anything, so don't expect me to be
Learn to think before you speak
And you just might make a point
Why is your problem always my emergency?
This is no court of law, you're all speculation
Sex masquerades as rock and roll
And manufactured music to save your soul
So go and do your homework
Demographics target marketing"
The Offspring,All I Want,Ixnay on the Hombre,12/31/1996,"Okay...
Ya ya ya ya ya

Day after day, your home life's a wreck
The powers that be just breathe down your neck
You get no respect, you get no relief
You gotta speak up and yell out your piece

So back off your rules, back off your jive
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone, I'm not asking a lot
I just don't want to be controlled

That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want

Ya ya ya ya ya

How many times is it gonna take
Till someone around you hears what you say?
You've tried being cool, you feel like a lie
You've played by their rules, now it's their turn to try

So back off your rules, back off your jive

Leave me alone, I'm not asking a lot
I just don't want to be controlled

That's all I want

I hate Dr. Martens

I'll cut you down and give you lip

I'll be paranoid and hungry by a quarter to ten
Watching reruns on my TV
I'm laughing off my ass at Three's Company
I don't know if I'm understood
But hearing Jimmy Buffett never sounded so good

Your enemy's you and so is your life (your life)

Mota!

I'm driving down to the barrio
Going 15 miles an hour 'cause I'm already stoned
Give the guy a twenty and wait in the car
He tosses me a baggie, then he runs real far
I take a hit, but it smells like a clove
Oh fuck, I got a baggie of oregano
This ritual is destroying me
But I guess it could be worse
It could be methedrine

Your memory's gone and so is your life (your life)

But losing out just never felt so right
Your enemy's you and your couch is your life (your life)

Now that you've gone away

Leaving flowers on your grave
Show that I still care
But black roses and Hail Marys
Can't bring back what's taken from me

I reach to the sky

Time to think of what to say
Time to go right back to yesterday
Time for movements in the past
Time for something that won't last
Not just fire quick and die off fast

Things are never what they seem
I'm stuck inside of someone else's dream
Someone else's dream
Problems never go away
I'm sick of being caught in yesterday

Every day it's still the same
Different faces, different names
But still stuck here playing these stupid games
Maybe soon I'll figure out
What life really is all about
My heart is filled so full of doubt

Don't turn around, just look ahead

Bitch, bitch, bitch
Your ego will destroy you

A dreamer and a kid
Who changes every day
Someone that has to talk
When he's got nothing to say

There's shit that you need to see
Hey kid, go on and live that life

You couldn't keep me here

Just two months waiting by the phone
She grew wings and I grew wheels
And now the dust covers my heels
I sent your letter next day
No-Dozed a lot and sat and stared

I'm not sticking around to watch you gloat this time-
'cuz it gets only close enough so you'll know you'll never have her heart
Just sometimes words and long waits in-between when she tries hard
To be mean you'll never have her heart
But you'll probably hate her you know she's just a name
But with smoke in her hair i could still smell how sweet she would be to kiss
And we talked about nothing until she had to go

I sat down next to you
I thought of all the boys that wanted to
I laughed out loud
Do you hate this band too?

And I'll stay out till it's done for me
And my legacy will be one that keeps pushing me away
So it's back to engines underfoot and miles of great disdain
They never understand the way I walk
And it's you that knows it's the way I talk
That keeps me from knowing
When I should see the things you're showing me
And it's you I want to do this to
And it's looks like that that'll make me stay with you
Keep your cool I'll be home soon

Than have my heart broken by you

Second guessing
Well I remember ever since that first day I saw you on the street
I always wanted you in the worst way
But now I can't compete
And I'm so, and you're so, we're both so

You made me feel like a criminal

You kept a smile
Though I would always walk the walk

You gave it all
I gave you reason to have doubt
I had to get out of here
I took the stairs
I don't wanna fight with you if I can't be the one to have you
You sat that chair like a queen in the kitchen
I memorized the lines your eyes made
At every squint you shot my way

We would drag ourselves to bed
And sleep took everything I had
I kept it up till he would call
You made me feel like a criminal
And then there's you
You kept a smile
Though I would always walk the walk

But you're miserable
And I'm useless
Always making up excuses
I made you cry too many times

So I'm hanging up that line
I'm throwing rocks at your floor
I'm knocking down your front door
I'm desperate tonight
And I just wanna fight
It's my confusion that lets me act so cold
So now I'll go go go
And you wanna be just left alone
Put down that phone
But if you want me, just call out ""Hey boy."""

And I will rain on your parade without a sound

Driving the old wreck
Trying to make it home somehow
One more pit stop at our favorite watering hole
The ghost of Christmas past
Swallowed all our pride
We'd opened up our story books
And water down the eyes
Our demons raise their glasses singing
""I propose a toast
To all my friends""
Who's buying the next round
Cup half empty Cup half full
Perspectives and beers
They weren't failures
Just the regulars of my favorite year
They come and go
Paying their toll
From mobile homes
Decaying old unsound minds
The ghost of Christmas future
Dancing
To the click of time
The beating of defeat
Shaking in his hands
A lifetime of retreat
And his regrets were ours
A time to say good-bye
I've been waiting so long
For you to call
My old friend
To all my friends
To all my friends
To all my friends
To all my friends
To all my friends

The sad look on your face
The timing and structure

A day late, a buck short
I'm writing the report
On losing and failing
When I move I'm flailing now

And it's happened once again

Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own

You'll show up and walk by
On the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave
We'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last
When he's gone, I won't come back

Love you so much I want to kill you
I love your face so much I wanna smack it off
I love your pants so much I wanna pull 'em down
I love you!
Got nothing but love today
Whip it out and fire away
Can you feel the pain in my heart?
Where's it hurt, man? Everywhere!
Look at me again and I'll hit you
Hate you so much I want to kill you
Love you so much I want to love you
Touch me again and I'll kick you

A porch and a driveway with a big garage
But I traded it in, I kept some faith
Laid my head down every night
And it seems so far away
It seems so far away
Remember me now, cause things always change
Five long years are gone
I've done some time
Sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
Remember me now, cause things always change
Five long years are gone
I've done some time
Sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
I learned some things about the places I saw
I learned some things about myself
I guess it came the hard way
Now I know what counts
I've got one prayer, it's in your confidence
I know all the places I don't want to be
Everyone's gone, there's no one, just me
Remember me now cause things always change
Five long years are gone
I've done some time

Remember me next time I go away
For the first time in my life I wanna stay
I could count one hand here today
The only things that matter to me anyway
And it seems so far away
It seems so far away
Remember me now cause things always change
Five long years are gone

Lighting fireworks, throwing bottles upstairs in the red room
Dave carried it up from the cellar
Bowl tank and all
Now we just have to take it on the roof
We can watch it fall
Who's gonna throw the toilet, who's gonna throw the toilet off the roof?
The landlord says you've got your your laws and I've got mine
Who's gonna throw the toilet, who's gonna throw the toilet off the roof?

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right

Enveloped now, encased by my worst fear
I've never felt the nausea of longing to feel nothing
I never wanted to cease to exist, just disappear
Fear memories are all that lie ahead
Never have I felt so lost
Fear tragedy is all that lies ahead
Never have I felt so dead
Once felt so warm, now I'm fucking freezing
I am the once embraced abandoned one
I raised my eyes up to the light in hopes of finding healing
No relief was mine, I was burnt by the sun

Let my life fly by
Do you ever stop
Stop to wonder why?

And time flies by
When everything is ok
It just turns out that life ain't that way
Big decisions overwhelm me and I know
Nothing's free
When I don't think of, think about much
People die and we don't know why
I could use some understanding
Human contact, sign that contract

I don't want to let my life fly by
Did you ever stop to wonder why-ever stop to
Wonder, wonder why?

And time stands still when no one understands you
When you don't quite understand yourself
But just know this that God is faithful
Even if you don't have faith yourself
There's nothing quite like being sure of
What's inside your heart
It's mostly simple but not so easy
To know just where to start

I don't want to let my life fly by
Did you ever stop to wonder why-ever stop to
Wonder, wonder why?

Tomorrow is another day
Another chance to make things right

Don't feel bad if you haven't figured out
Cause I'm not mad there's really no need to shout
There's really no way you could have estimated
That you would ever in your life be so frustrated

If you knew what was good for you
You'd lock me up and throw away the key
You don't need me and no you never will
You never did as far as I can tell

Should I wake up and explain myself to you
Or should I not care and sleep the whole day thru
Finding the sense in everything
Is like going through my head to find a diamond ring
Living day by day is all that I can say
Something someone to believe in might be the
Other way
We can't know for sure until we open the door
Inherent choices, choices I can't take anymore

If you knew what was good for you
You'd lock me up and throw away the key
You don't need me and no you never will
You never did as far as I can tell

And I can't wait for the day when things
Turn around
You don't own me

The piece of paper you have says that you
Can get into my pocket
But you can't get inside my heart or inside my head
Money doesn't mean to me what it obviously means to you
Cause I would never steal from kids that don't have a clue

How much more can our people bear?
Need no more division
Need no more pride and I

In water smells
The skyline filled with shipping yards
And factories had me dreaming of
Waking up
Am I dreaming? is this really me?
Because I've never felt so not lonely
And if this could be real right now
Then everyday for the rest of my life
I will search for moments full of you
But let's hope tomorrow won't cave in
'cause I'm looking for someone to
Change me
And you make me feel so tall
I always want to be this tall 'cause maybe I'll be original
And sometimes things you say
Just make me think in different ways
So this is my way of saying
I could be the one who's dragged home at night
Away from all my hopeless dreams
You and me will forge some future
Because we don't want to be waiting
For something right to go wrong"
Saves the Day,Blindfolded,Can't Slow Down,08/11/1998,"So now I've made the decision to walk behind you
In the dark, for the rest of my life
And I'll never show my face again
Because it's too scarred and bloody to be enough
And I don't have the right stuff
All I have are empty boxes to carry away your heart
And I think that tonight
I will sneak into your house
And I'll sing songs to wake you up
And I'll take you blindfolded, dancing onto bridges
And you'll say you don't want to be with me
No one ever does
And no one ever thinks of me that way
But I will even drive you home
If you never let me forget about you
And if you promise me that I'm good enough for someone
'Cause I've got to be good enough for you
And someday soon I'll get it right
And then you'll see just how good I can be
So don't ask me about forever because
Right now I'm feeling lost
But there's got to be some place for me because
If there isn't, where will I go?
Will there be some place for me
And will you be there waiting?
When we get there, please catch me
Before I crawl all the way home
Catch me, before I crawl all the way home
Catch me, catch me
Before I crawl all the way home
But I won't stop until you do"
Saves the Day,Deciding,Can't Slow Down,08/11/1998,"And it's not fair- why do I have to be so low?
Oh, I feel everything much more
Much more than you ever will
And it's too hard when I can't even catch your eye
So I can't send you messages
And at night I dream of reasons I can't let you go
I don't know if it's time to crack through your walls
So thick that I can't see past you
And last summer wasn't enough for me
And now that winter comes
The cold beats harder
And no one is left alone
And I'm offering you me right now - Take me I'm yours
And I won't have it any other way
So don't let fools be carried by what I say
The night keeps lookin' our way
And you're not seein' what I'm missin'
Cause I am missing you
And I think that we should run as fast as we can
Into what we dont know
It's time to let me in
Because I feel just fine"
Saves the Day,Handsome Boy,Can't Slow Down,08/11/1998,"I said, ""that boy's handsome""
And a little bit of me wanted to be beautiful
Carrie said, ""It's hard to look in the mirror these days
When everyone has everything you'd rather be.""
There's just something about his smile
He looks so nice
I wish I had friends like that
They'd always be there for me
I wouldn't look bad
Yeah, they wouldn't talk behind my back"
Saves the Day,Jodie,Can't Slow Down,08/11/1998,"Tonight I'll stay awake long enough
To stop breathing
And I wonder how long it will take
Before I pass out
Drunk off night skies
Lying on hills
Wet grass below
Blue black above
I will carry all the weights tonight
Cause I keep remembering the day that
You said you might go crazy
If you spent one more minute with me
Well I been thinking about those days and I don't know
Is one more minute going to kill you now?
Stop me before I say too much
So now I've been alone and it's been going
But tomorrow might not come
If I don't let it
So don't forget the mornings that we spent
Deep inside out heads
Staring at blank walls
Cause that's what counts
And I don't know
But I'm trying to let you go
And I can't cut too well
These strings I have around my neck
I'm trying to let you go
I'm trying to let you go
I'm doin this by myself
Now I've been alone and its been going
But tomorrow might not come
If I don't let it so
Don't forget the mornings that we spent
Deep inside out heads
Staring at blank walls
That's what counts
And I don't know
But I'm trying to let you go
And I can't cut too well
These strings I have around my neck
I'm trying to let you go
I'm trying to let you go
I'm doin this by myself
Don't forget we sent
Letters to ourselves
Without words
And it was just to remember
Just to remember
Just to remember
Just to remember those days
That we spent in our heads"
Saves the Day,"Sometimes, New Jersey",Can't Slow Down,08/11/1998,"I called you up to see if maybe we could hang
I told you I was nervous and feeling lonely
I bit my lip, and you were like, ""fucking hell yeah.""
It made me smile
I thought of how beautiful the night would be
I thought maybe we could drive around
Talking 'bout your town
Or stay at home
I could win you over acting cool
Real fucking romance"
Saves the Day,The Choke,Can't Slow Down,08/11/1998,"Don't leave yet
It's still early and I haven't even said a word and I'm hoping
That I might upset you
Saying what I want to
'Cause it's not like you don't know I've fallen for
But it's in my head and that's where you can't see it
And I thought that maybe if I'd like to
Bite the tip of my finger
I'd stumble over words
And tell you just how far
Before I hit the ground
And I'm the type to think of all the wrong things to say
I will shut myself up
And I never come out
Close all my doors
Only show you the black spots where my eyes once were
I can say this
IIIIIIIII can say this
IIIIIIIII can say this
I will collect myself deep down
Then I'll come out punching now
I can collect myself down
I'll come out punching now

Here I go again
I'm stuck in this rut
And I'm not sure how to begin
Should I tell you everything?
I'm feeling out of luck
So I won't see you soon
Cause I know its too soon
For you to see me
If this is the last thing you do
Just tell me that it's okay
For me to have these feelings for you
And it's normal to want to call you
Oh I'm dialing the phone
Letting it ring for hours
Pretending to hear your voice
Why does my heart always
Beat before yours does?
After a while, ?you can
Make yourself
Believe in almost anything
So I'm making myself believe in you"
Alkaline Trio,Clavicle,Goddamnit,10/13/1998,"I've been on top of the world since about six months ago
Marking the first time I laid eyes on you
I lost all train of thought as I entered the room
I saw what looked like really good food
Then I saw you and so did you

I wanna wake up naked next to you
Kissing the curve in your clavicle
Kissing your clavicle

I've been on top of the world since about one week ago
Marking a time when I was drunk enough to talk to you
I lost all train of thought as your eyes met mine
Told you I thought you were gorgeous
You gave me your phone number, I gave you mine
Before you left, I said that you can bet I'll be bothering you soon
You said, ""No bother, please do.""
I've called you twice
It's been a hellish plight to not think about you all the time
Sitting around waiting for your call

I wanna wake up naked next to you
Kissing the curve in your clavicle
Kissing your clavicle
I wanna wake up naked next to you
Kissing the curve of your clavicle"
Alkaline Trio,Cringe,Goddamnit,10/13/1998,"Wide eyed, knee deep in surprise
Just below your thighs, the temperature drops five degrees
Your standby flight has just arrived
Tongue-tied, bleeding from your eyes
Even Christ himself would cringe at the sight of your scars
While you're counting sheep, I'll count my lucky stars
You were the last good thing I ever saw
And I lost it all
I lost it all

Burned out on two hours of shut eye
Eyes glazed at the thought of the next eight hours
Headwind, cold rain to wake me
You were the last good thing I ever saw"
Alkaline Trio,Nose Over Tail,Goddamnit,10/13/1998,"Cracked my head open on your kitchen floor
To prove to you that I have brains
Meanwhile, tin men are led by little girls
Down golden roads that lead to nowhere

Fine time to fake a seizure
To feel your mouth on mine
You're saving me

Whatever happened to that silly dream you had?
I want to make it real
I'd love to rub your back
Like a plane crash that never hits the ground
I fall in love with you
I'm nose over tail for you

Your voice like the sound of sirens
To a house on fire
You're saving me"
Alkaline Trio,San Francisco,Goddamnit,10/13/1998,"Choking on the thought of leaving
Drinking to keep from sobbing
4 PM, four dollar pints
The SFO, the time and price

With all my happiness aborted
The PA painfully starts boarding
I sink deep, thirty thousand feet
Into my window seat electric chair

And I was drinking you goodbye
A heart floats in the bay
From sour home Chicago
I hear you beating far away
And there's no telling what I'll do
If I don't return to you

Hopeful thoughts of soon returning
Can't put out my stomach burning
Plastic wings and plastic smiles
Unsalted peanuts to stretch my miles

Choking on the thought of leaving
Drinking to keep from heaving
5 PM, five dollar pints
Hellbound Airlines, time and price

And I was drinking you goodbye
A heart floats in the bay
From sour home Chicago
I hear you beating far away
And there's no telling what I'll do
If I don't return to you
I was drinking you goodbye

I'm assuming you have met some other guy
So I sit in my room, watch Romeo & Juliet a thousand times
And I wish I was as cool as Leonardo is.
But I'm not
I went on Jerry Springer to confess my love to you
You said I didn't have a chance and there was nothing I could do
You told me I was crazy and wished that I was dead
You threw a chair right upside my head
Today I hijacked a plane
I wrote your name across the sky: Miss Claire Danes
But they were waiting on the ground
To take me straight to jail
I'm staring at your pictures from my lonely little cell
I'm writing you this letter to let you know I'm doing well
Until we meet again, you know I'll cry a thousand tears
And I'll see you in another twenty years
I'll see you in another twenty years"

Rehabilitate with all the others
Oh! Well, I'll see ya

That car looked so tempting, so easy to drive
Just like that apartment that you burglarized
You started to run, but didn't get far
'Cause under your arm was a VCR


I'm innocent
I didn't do it
I didn't do nothin', man
This is bullshit
He gave it to me... it was, it was a present
Ho ho, not this time, my friend
You'll be in lockdown by ten
I'm afraid you can't talk your way out of this one, son
Now four walls are your 24-hour-a-day, constant companions


Well, I'll see ya
Have a nice life!"
Blink-182,Josie,Dude Ranch,11/17/1998,"Yeah, my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero just because
Yeah, just because

And my girlfriend likes UL and DHC
And she's so smart and independent, I don't think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer

And when I feel like giving up, like my world is falling down
I show up at 3 A.M., she's still up watching Vacation
And I see her pretty face, it takes me away to a better place, and

I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine

Yeah, my girlfriend takes collect calls from the road
And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge

Lagwagon,After You My Friend,Let's Talk About Feelings,11/24/1998,"Here he is, he saves a grin
He wants to be the one who doesn't have to sink a level
Indiscrete, in his retreat
All he needs is just a taste of the bitter pride
He held in her name
Embrace the solitude of ordinary fucked up state of grace
Far away from the days he bared the cross she used to wear
In some resolve well aware
A little pitiful, a pin-up boy they dress in grieving wear
Well at ease in consent in the drift of undertow
He won't justify the pity from them
When he knows....fools in love are arrogant
Their sermons cloud his breathing air
He's in love with an isolation from emotion
Here he is awaiting sentence
A fool to think that anyone can escape guilt and anguish
A subtlety that can't be learned
A subtlety that can't be taught
He is caught in the lure of second thoughts
He might still care
As he settles down well aware
Bound in secrecy, his voice will only dignify their fears
But sorrow is signified
He's well aware of his pride"
Lagwagon,Change Despair,Let's Talk About Feelings,11/24/1998,"Everything that I've done here into one in keeping with...
Some earned conviction, some stagnation, some change despair
Dissapointed and odds
In a costume you can't take off
Leave it behind. I know that this time I get in for free
Our latest rendition lame
Reincarnate, return the same
Still the best times are here now
Now that I'm bored, now that I'm numb
Done, I know this is wrong
Safe in that stance but incomplete
I leave it behind. I know that this time I get in for free
Some of it's habitual
Some of it's predictable
Sometimes the change is not enough
And in the lost empathy
Memories of better days"

Answer to those you have failed
Time to clean up your room and show you are able to stop
Beating yourself down
You've arrived
A wealth of respect, a world of regard
You've always belonged
You have to go on
I just want you to feel the gun in your hand
You used to hold aspiration
You couldn't see the limitations
Even in your youth you were unsurpassed
But driven by grief and it couldn't last
Sometimes promise, sometimes goodbye
Confessed to all through bloodshot eyes
I just want you to feel the gun in your hand (yeah)
It only breaks you until you get off
I'm not gonna watch you kill yourself to live

Cover me in resolve
So please leave the imagery
I can twist it
Dissociation and obsession
Superstition and pain
I can carry them on too and bury you once again

I'd apologize
I live to hear you say what they can't
I would make amends

I'd give anything to bring you back to say goodbye"

And your love story's bad
Drama makes you livid
In a nervous always laugh
I'm fresh out of advice
And sick of standing in this harms way
Interstate, in debate, an impasse
Driving out of hope and gas
Arriving at the same mute conclusion
This destination failure
This is going, going
Nowhere slow
Drama is exhausting and I'd rather be alone
I want better friends
I'm sick of getting into harms way
And so are they
Sick of being around something
That's destined to fail
And the sum of it's parts cannot see
They make me hate life, hate friends
Hate being there
I know, that it's not funny but it's true
No one gives a shit but you

Maybe someday you'll stop"

As there's no gain in failure
You succeed at being mine
Yeah, old friend, see you there
I will be proud from afar
I can paint a picture
In a moment of memories
And there aren't many left
I am extradited, uninvited

Take a step to freedom
You and her against this cruel world
Take a breath of shelter
And exhale trust and allegiance
Liberate yourself from hell

Speak of it
The loyalties that have been broken
Mine isn't dead
One thing is true
Nothing is sacred
When everyone's talking
And nobody's listening
When we confide in all
Those friends
They're just messengers
One thing is true
You throw the matters into
Blue skies
Turning to grey
Falling out every day
One thing that's free

Late, I can stay up late
In and out of bed
Cleaning up the mess
Inside my head"

Now, all that I have
To stand on
Grieving from a different
Point of view
I learn its meaning from you
In life and death
And continue
...But faith is just a
Silent tribute
Mine is just a desperate act
Give him back
I owe him
Throw me a line, I'll suspend
My disbelief
And concede
Following your lead
Faithfully
Led into this concession with
Hope and doubt
A seemingly futile gesture
My faith is just a silent tribute
This is just a desperate act
Holding on
It's just this desperation that
Takes me home"

The sympathy
They've taken everything you want and they
Left you all alone
My setting sun, self appointed
I am a fraud
You are the martyr
It's decided and I owe you several worlds
I can tell you...
Rat in the sewer, scraps they left behind
Once their visionary, and they all have robbed you blind
Your broken records playing for
None fabricate song
Amputated creative tongue
You sing on and on and on
I can tell you why
I'm bringing you down
Calling you out
Taking your shield
It's easier now
Years have been kind
Distance between
Has given hind sight
I jumped a train
Your tragedy so easy to read
Is bitter envy
They're reaping all the lowly benefits
You missed the train they stole
And you've never...
I'm burning you down
Calling you out
Taking your shield
It's easier now
Years have been kind
Distance between has given hind sight
I'm on a train"
Rancid,Brad Logan,Chef Aid: The South Park Album,12/08/1998,"California sun has sunk
Behind the Anaheim Hills, here comes the night
I was high on junk
And the warm winds of Santa Anna feel alright
Will every crimmin' hood make a bargain with the world
Seats are successive when you're shot to the curb
I spend my day in blindness, at night I get my vision
Dodgy, cause there are no one indecision
Cause it's wild, well it's wild, wild, wild, wild
California sun has sunk
Behind the Anaheim Hills, here comes the night
I was high on junk
And the warm winds of Santa Anna feel alright
I get destructive outside obedience
I am no longer respected in this new transition
I put into effect, my long time standard
Disastrous living, disastrous living!
Cause it's wild, cause it's wild, wild, wild, wild

We can't do a thing but wait
So let's wait for one more

And the time, such clumsy time
In deciding if it's time
I'm careful but not sure how it goes
You can lose yourself in your courage

When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?

And the mindless comfort grows
When I'm alone with my great plans
And this is what she said gets her through it
""If I don't let myself be happy now, then when?
If not now, when?""

When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?

I close my eyes and believe
Wherever you are, an angel for me

When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?"

I walked right in and took a seat
Cute drunk boy I long to meet
Sat alone
No one bought me drinks
I gave up cuz Irish Boys stink!
Open the bottle
Step inside
Pop open the cork and wave goodbye
To the stupid Irish Boys
Who never get the chance
To know me
Sweep me off my feet
Or get into my pants
I'll come back one day with a real man
He'll kiss my lips and he'll hold my hand
He'll show me off so everyone knows
Kiss my ear and suck my toes
Never puke on my shoes
Sing those sorry drunken tunes
When we go out, he'll buy me drinks --
He's not Irish, Irish boys stink!
Yea irish boys stink!
So in walks this cute lad
Decides to tell me how much beer he's had
Sets me up to put me on my throne
Then decides to take me home
Right as we get to the bed
He's so drunk he's passed out dead
This is why I've come to think
Those fuckin Irish Boys, they stink!
Open the bottle
Step inside
Pop open the cork and wave goodbye

Say no to your superiors
Say no to losing all your time
Say no to corporate policy
Just say no and don't forget your spine
You say it's an obligation
So there goes your vacation
Programmed to do what they say
Obey commands and you'll do fine, do things their way
They treat you like you're worthless
Your life has got no purpose

In the dark night, I will let you impale me
Picnic in the cemetery, turn off the lights and scream BLOODY MARY!

I know why you weren't there-you spent the night in the witch's lair
I ripped her heart in two, this is the gift to you

Watch out, I'll lure in a pit of boiling brew
You said no one was as creepy as me, and we'd be together eternally
Give me back my plate of maggots, I never told you...

Found another to be mine, his name is Frankenstien
And on our ceiling hangs the head of your Miss Thang
I'll caress his green skin, and together we'll live in sin

But I know that it's not right
I probably shouldn't tell you
But I dreamt of you last night
I guess I'm not prepared to say
Goodbye, so long, farewell, I won't be seeing you again
Until next time that he goes away
You told me that you loved me
I started tearing down those walls
I really started to trust you
But you set me up to take the fall

Goodbye, so long, farewell, I won't be seeing you again

You looked so beautiful, I never will forget
Then you opened up your eyes, looked at me and kinda smiled
I was scared, but still happy at the same time
I never wanted us to be a superficial family
But, in the end, it was the only thing we could be
Angie, I'm sorry I wasn't right for you
Just what did you expect for me to do?
You know that I would have done anything for you
I sometimes think about how things could be
If you would've took a chance and moved out here with me
We'd cruise along the 101 in the California sun
Sing Descendents songs and have ourselves lots of fun
Stay out drinking really late, stumble home from lower State
Treat every day like it would be our first date
Angie, I'm sorry that you weren't right for me
I guess that it just wasn't meant to be
I quit pretending you were in love with me"

Repackaged and reprocessed for the world
I'd love to kick you in the face, break your legs
And throw you from a train

And you're with me all the time
And lots of feelings that I can't explain

I won't spend another night alone
I won't spend another night alone

Out of every girl I meet
No other can compete
I'd ditch them all for a night with you
I know you don't believe
You mean this much to me
But I promise you that you do

If I had one wish, this is what it would be
I'd ask you to spend all your time with me
And we'd be together forever
We'd buy a small house in South Central L.A
Raise lots of kids, then we'd both join a gang
Just as long as we're together

The things you make me wanna do
I'd rob a Kwik-E-Mart for you
I'd go to the pound an let all the cats go free

'Cause I'm not scared

Why are you looking for an answer
When you still don't know the question?
It's like lighting candles in the rain
Sometimes life can be a pain
But don't give up without a fight
Sometimes when you feel afraid
Don't give up and run away
'Cause two wrongs don't make it right
What's the point in crying
When you've done nothing wrong?
It was right there all along
The world is nothing but a lie
And everyone is going to die
But what can I say?
Just help me make it through today
You don't need a destination
Just to go somewhere in life
It's like throwing feathers at the wind
They come right back to you again
So why not give it one more try?

It doesn't mean you shouldn't dream
Just don't get your hopes to high

Your world comes crashing down"

And the fire's burning bright
And still we act like everything's all right
I guess if we ignore it, it'll probably go away
If you believe that bullshit please see exhibit A
Forget about friendship
Hey, let's destroy the enemy
Well, if there's one thing that I've learned
My enemies are just as close to me
You keep your problems deep inside
You always play that game of run and hide
Even though they told you, ""To see is to believe""
It didn't take you long to know that looks, they can deceive
Don't give up fighting till nothing else stands in your way
Don't give up talking until there's nothing left to say
But no matter what you do
Don't ever compromise what you believe
Don't ever compromise what you believe
Don't ever compromise what you believe"

Went on all the rides, didn't have to wait in line
I drove you to your house where we stared up at the stars
I listened to your heartbeat as I held you in my arms
We hung out at the Rainbow where we drank till half past two
Nothing could go wrong anytime that I'm with you
Like crashing a hotel room or leading up to that first kiss
Or searching for a high school that you know doesn't exist
These are the things that make me free
I feel like I'm stuck in ""Stand by Me""
This night was too good to be true
Today I woke up alone wishing you were here with me
I wanted us to be something that we'd probably never be
Today you called me up and said you'd see me at our show
But now I'm stuck debating if I even wanna go
Whitney, don't you understand that what I say is true?
I just want you to know I have a major crush on you
I'd drive you to Las Vegas and do the things you wanna do
I'd even have Wayne Newton dedicate a song to you
I only wish that this could be
Just dump your boyfriend and go out with me
I swear I'd treat you like a queen"

Just when I opened up my heart
The one you used to love came and ripped it right apart
Why do I never seem to learn that
Love is wrong and girls are fucking evil?
I guess I'll never figure out
What womankind is all about
I heard your voice again today
I'm scarred by all the lies that were once promises you made
I lie in bed awake at night
And wonder what went wrong or even more just what went right
Why do I never seem to learn that
Love is wrong and girls are fucking evil?
I guess I'll never figure out

When I was there, he kept you waiting
And I'm still here, waiting there
To catch you if you fall
I don't know why I care so much
When I shouldn't care at all

How much you mean to me
You said that I was your best friend
A real sweet guy, but that's all I'd ever be

Dig out the key, put it in the lock and open the door for her. Then you let her get in. Then you close the door. Then you walk around the back of the car and look through the rear window. If she doesn't reach over and lift up that button so that you can get in, dump her.""

Looking for something to be when i stopped to look around

Close it so beautifully
I'll let animosity unwind
Steal away the darkened pages
Hidden so shamefully
I'll still feel the violence of the lies

And miles away my mother cries
Omnipotence nurturing malevolence

Do you wanna come to a party
My friends picked me up in a truck at 11:30
This thing's at a frat house
But people are cool there
Reluctant I followed
But I never dreamed there
Would be someone there who
Would catch my attention
I wasn't out searching
For love or affection
So I payed my three in
And the girls got in free
Shined the beer for tequila
And we headed into the party

And then in the backyard
Some terrible ska band
Someone in the background
Was doing a keg stand
This place is so lame
All these girls look the same
All these guys have no game
I wished I would've stayed
In my bed back at home, watching TV alone
Where I'd put on some porn
Or have sex on the phone
Far from people I hate
Down from Anywhere State
Trying to intoxicate girls
To give them head after the party

And then I saw her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She wasn't wearing underwear
At least I prayed that
She might be the one
Maybe we'd have some fun
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
But that night I learned some girls try too hard

(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
And some girls try
Too hard to impress with
The way that they dress with
Those things on their chests and
The things they suggest to me

I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
The names she was dropping
The games she was playing
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Flys
How she's down with
The wise well-constructed disguise
Now I'd rather go dateless
Than stay here and hate this
Her volume of makeup
Her fake tits were tasteless
So I said I'd call her
But never would bother
Until I got turned down
By another girl at a party

So when you see her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She won't be wearing underwear
And you'll discover
This girl's not the one
And she'll never be fun
So you should just turn and run
Because you'll find out that
Some girls try too hard

(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
And some girls try
Too hard to impress with
The way that they dress with
Those things on their chests and
The things they suggest to me

(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
Some girls try too hard"
Blink-182,What's My Age Again?,Enema of the State,06/01/1999,"I took her out
It was a Friday night
I wore cologne
To get the feeling right
We started making out
And she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

Then later on
On the drive home
I called her mom
From a payphone
I said I was the cops
And your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?

(What's my age again?) That's about the time that she broke up with me
(Please stay with me) No one should take themselves so seriously
(Please stay with me) With many years ahead to fall in line
(Please stay with me) Why would you wish that on me?
(Please stay) I never wanna act my age
(With) What's my age again?
(Me) What's my age again?"

I don't think I can forget you now
I once sat up on my roof and examined the planning of my town
I saw the structured grid and pavement cutting through the grass
And I remembered the cold of winter running up the legs of my pants
I picked the nicest lawn and imagined the two of us rolling around down along the ground
I saw myself touch your face and I noticed jets begin to race above our heads
But I pinched my arm and remembered how much you hate me
I remembered the fact that I can't see what you need
And I'm too stupid to be aware of the beauty that you give this place
And how shitty this town would be without you in it
I don't think I can forget you now
When you aren't around I let the shades fall down to shut out
All the sun's light and make myself feel alright
What am I doing with my life?
Oh well, you've got me under your spell and I don't think that I'm kidding around
I don't think I can forget you now
Remember that the only things we need sometimes are chilly nights and warmer thighs
'cause theres nothing like being held sometimes"

Through the park, and over McDougal
The torches were blazing above our street
And just down from the sky
Casey stepped with Anna off the curb
His shoes are clogs, did you see? did you see?
They dipped in that puddle
The one catching green
They were tripping up and slipping around
Singing Rosie
And oh,oh,oh, I wanted to pull you down
Roll on top of me baby,yeah, just roll
Roll roll
We'll wreck our clothes
We'll scrape our knees
We'll taste the scabs
You, sweet, are worth these next four months
Until I bail out,yeah,kiss behind your ears
Drive off in the van
Oh my god, I think I'm dying in this car seat
Where I'll spend through winter
I dont know if I can go
I dont know, not through with you
I dont know if I can go
I dont know, not through with you"
Saves the Day,Jessie & My Whetstone,Ups & Downs: Early Recordings and B-Sides,07/01/1999,"To me, the only thing left after a while
Was that night we watched
Documentaries up through morning
Then you kicked me out
You opened up the screen door
And threw me out on the porch
It was summer then
And I drove home whistling
Down the pike, yeah
And that was that
Our one sweet night together
And under highway signs
I watched our love start fluttering
Dissipating
I counted all the headlights
To make sure I was alright
Now I'm wondering
Is it me or is it me
That can't see silver linings
So I fucked it up
I watched you go
I saw my hand not dialing the phone
And all I'm left to do
Is remember the dull room
We stared at blue screen light
Watching the strike of '59
Dreamed of wrecking my underwear
Oh can I touch your cheek somewhere
Under dark filled rainy nights
With my socks stuck in the mud, yeah
Please come dive in puddles with me
Our one sweet night together
Our one sweet night together
And under highway signs
I watched our love start fluttering
Dissipating
I counted all the headlights
To make sure I was alright"
Saves the Day,Take Our Cars Now!,Ups & Downs: Early Recordings and B-Sides,07/01/1999,"Don't you remember the last time
I was speeding down this highway
And Anna slept in the backseat
Dreaming in the autumn heat
And we turned up the country radio and
Said if you want me just say so
And I slicked back my hair in the wind
And I told you I didn't want my picture taken
But you snapped it anyway now I guess now
I guess you won't have trouble remembering me someday, someday
So I floored it, swerved around the lanes
And I kept wishing it was you
Instead of me behind the wheel
So maybe with my camera I could steal a shot of you
And go home to put in my room
And I told you I didn't want my picture taken
But you snapped it anyway now I guess now
I guess you won't have trouble remembering me someday, someday
But maybe, you'll never remember me
Maybe my face will lose these scars
Cause sometimes they keep me home at night
Where I duck under the covers and wince when I see the light
(whoa oa whoa oa whoa oa whoa oa)
And I told you I didn't want my picture taken
But you snapped it anyway now I guess now
I guess you won't have trouble remembering me someday, someday

His hair is stickin' up a little in the front
Yeah, he's losin' it just a bit
When I get home tonight, I'll miss him
In Hampshire, yeah
His glasses
The way he writes in purple pen
The way his collar falls to the left
Have you seen his ankles lately?
I know he's next to me
I feel his sweater here
But when im sleepin', it's only green sheets
And the hair down my legs
I think I'll write you, Leif
When I'm near Tuesday
Sometime before you go

Besides, a purple sky is better soaring for you, my angel
You're an angel, you little devil
As for me, I'll stay inside
I'll be just fine and I'll watch from the window

Cannot categorize the nature of this sickness
A miracle that you're alive
Stuck to the roof of my mouth with a staple
Remember last April when we saw U.S. Maple?
Somehow, the singer showed the Fireside exactly how I feel

And we say goodbye and go underground
Or up towards the sky, up in smoke, burnt down to size
At least we're still friends
At least we're still alive

Take your wings outside, no use for them in here
Bad luck to open inside
Work like umbrellas, like a broken mirror
It's getting clearer, the end is closer
Than ever before and you'll want nothing more
When your head hits the floor and you're lost in the darkness

And we say goodbye and go underground
Or up towards the sky, up in smoke, burnt down to size
At least we're still friends
At least we're still alive
And we say goodbye and go underground

As I'd fallen

You're like a swimming pool
Hypnotic blue, and I fell in
So take my hand, we'll swim around
Kiss me hard, until I drown

I wanna be your shirt
So I can hug you while you work
I wanna be your wife
So you can beat me every night

You're like a toothpick to teeth, mintiful
You're like a metaphor for something else
You're like a teen flick soundtrack
You're sharper than a Ginsu thumbtack
You cut my can
So say you're mine, I'll give you back
Take these hands, they'll squeeze back

I wasn't supposed to forget your taste
Like nights spent figuring all the ways that we came to this place
There we were alone on top of your old rooftop in Highland Park
Ask me now
Say, ""Chris, look out across the sky and tell me which way the wind blows.""
A core of coal
A core of coal and starches
A core of coal and starches within me
Even now that you're not here
I climb these mountains of houses every night
I say your name, wish I could have done things right"
Saves the Day,Banned from the Back Porch,Through Being Cool,11/02/1999,"I stepped out into the night
Put my feet down on the wet patio floor
The sky's air had been cooling
Steam rose from everywhere
I could feel drops of rain slipping off tree's leaves
Spattering to the ground
It's always misty after a summer pour
I remember turning around and looking out
And staring in and focusing on that one beautiful girl

And I said, ""Oh, who is this?
Where was she all those crazy years?
Oh, who is this?
Where was she when my heart couldn't take its beat?""

I sipped down
Warm ginger ale
Drew back a breath
And headed over to see about this girl
I couldn't say a thing and I stared open and wide
And connected with her eyes to feel my gut fall through the floor

Breeze in my window

Ignore all our neighbors
I think I'll bring you breakfast
Play Johnny Cash on the stereo
I'll sit in the lazy chair all day remembering the things you do
So when you come home
I'll jump up to kiss you

And it will knock you back
You'll fall over our TV set
I'll pick you up to dust you off
""Baby, let's give it a go.""
Kiss your thighs to make you feel all right

To taste a little sweat

Steal Cadillacs for a living"

Is tearing me apart

Maybe I should fly out to Montana

Out past the electric lines
Out where no one will know my name

Banging on the door

Won't you tell your daughter I'm all alone
And I'm not handling this well.""

I took a piss that lasted longer than you and your manipulations
Called my mom last night
She said, ""Sweetie, you don't need someone
Who's more fleeting than fall""

Don't you love those leaves?
Don't you wish the orange stayed forever?
And crickets sang in the night
All through winter

And I thought, slow down
Think of all the times this jerk has fucked you up and left you down
And hey, I choose my company by the beating of their hearts
Not the swelling of their heads, no

Don't you love those leaves?
Don't you wish the orange stayed forever?

If I could somehow make you mine

Our nights underneath ocean skies

I can hear some dogs barking in the back yards
I smell gasoline
I wish the sky were open 'cause if there weren't those trees
I think I could see for miles
The city is just beyond those clouds
And I guess this is what it's like to be really down
And holding out for something
Remembering the warm nights
Remembering the open arms of two years ago
There's nothing like this parking lot
And seeing the stars in morning

Through the swamp and trees of southern night
I'll always have those mornings in

California, where the mountains climb so tall
And waves crash blue around you
Everyone's passed out in the van
And I'm the one driving through the land

Alone and open roading
Ted's out in the seat right next to me
He's drooling on his sleeve
Who ever made up open skies and two of the bluest eyes
Must be some young phenom

California, where the mountains climb so tall
And waves crash blue around you
Everyone's passed out in the van
And I'm the one driving through the land

Sometimes taking off can open up your eyes
To everything that lies in your heart
That's when you miss your home
Trees seem a little deader
I think we're getting back tonight
Would you care if I came over?
I've missed you about three weeks now
I'm dying just to taste your lips
Could we stomp around your back yard
And wreck our clothes in the mud?

And I just want you to know
That every pool of water reminds me of you
Is that all right?
I hope you think it's cool
Sometimes a train can't go as fast as I want it to

Did you know, my sweet
That I once took the liberty of watching you in your sleep?
I rolled over and over
Trying to touch your knees underneath the sheets
Trying to touch your knees

Everything seemed a little easier
When we weren't one hundred miles apart
The person across from me
Sitting in her train seat, reminded me of you
And I looked out past her cheeks
Through the glass-light conduit
The sun had sunk
Disappeared into New Jersey

Yeah, like how I'm such a fool and oh, that I'm so receptive

I'll spin right back around
And say, ""Nick, why are you such a prick?
Why don't you just marvel in the hopes that make up this reality?
Your world is what you made it
And I don't want a part of it
Chill out."""
Saves the Day,You Vandal,Through Being Cool,11/02/1999,"Last night I dreamt you called from Costa Rica
The place you've been the last two weeks
You said, ""I miss you, oh sweet boy, and will you come on down?""
I woke up to my cold sheets and the smell of New Jersey
When do I get to wake up to you?
Tonight I can't forget that I've got these open wounds
It's such a drag
I can't forget you've gone
My ribs have parted ways
They said, ""We're not going to protect this heart you have.""

Whoa hey, what can I do?
My lungs are breathing open air
My spleen is dripping from my pants
Whoa hey, what can I do?
You've left me in the cold
And I miss you

You never told me it would be this hard
I think my body's saying so
When you aren't here, it's got to go
It's leaving me
But I hope that you're okay
Even though I'm dying
I hope that you're still trying to have a killer time
Go see the volcanoes
Go see the rainforests
I'll be fine by myself
Yeah, I'll be fine without these bones

Whoa hey, what can I do?
My lungs are breathing open air
My spleen is dripping from my pants
Whoa hey, what can I do?
You've left me in the cold
And I miss you
Whoa hey, miss you
Whoa hey, miss you"
NOFX,The Decline,The Decline,11/23/1999,"Where are all the stupid people from?
And how'd they get to be so dumb?
Bred on purple mountain range
Feed amber waves of grains
To lesser human beings, zero feelings
Blame it on
Human nature, mans destiny (mans destiny)
Blame it on the greediocracy (greediocracy)
Fear of God
The fear of change
The fear of truth
Add the Bill of Rights, subtract the wrongs
There's no answers
Memorize and sing star spangled songs
When the questions
Aren't ever asked
Is anybody learning from the past?
We're living in united stagnation
Father what have I done?
I took that .22
A gift to me from you
To bed with me each night
Kept it clean
Polished it well
Cherished every cartridge, every shell
Down, by the creek, under brush, under dirt
There's a carcass of my second kill
Down, by the park, under stone, under pine
There's a carcass of my brother William
Brother where, have you gone to?
I swear, I never thought I could
I see so many times
They told me to shoot straight
Don't pull the trigger, squeeze
That will insure a kill
A kill is what you want
A kill is why we breed
The Christians love their guns
The church and NRA
Pray for their salvations
Prey on the lower faiths
The story book's been read
And every line believed
Curriculum's been set
Logic is a threat
Reason searched and seized
Jerry spent some time in Michigan
A twenty year vacation, after all he had a dime
A dime is worth a lot more in Detroit
A dime in California, a twenty dollar fine
Jerry only stayed a couple months
It's hard to enjoy yourself while bleeding out the ass
Asphyxiation is simple and fast
It beats seventeen fun years of being someone's bitch
Don't think (Stay)
Drink your wine (Home)
Watch the fire burn (Be)
His problems not mine (Safe)
Just be that model citizen
I wish I had a schilling
(For each senseless killing)
For every senseless killing
I'd buy a government
America's for sale
And you can get a good deal on it
(A good deal on it)
And make a healthy profit
Or maybe, tear it apart
Start with assumption
That a million people are smart
Smarter than one
Serotonin's gone
She gave up, drifted away
Sara fled, thought process gone
She left her answering machine on
The greeting left spoken sincere
Messages no one will ever hear
Ten thousand messages a day
A million more transmissions lay
Victims of the laissez faire
Ten thousand voices, a hundred guns
A hundred decibels turns to one
One bullet, one empty head
Now with Serotonin gone
The man who used to speak
Performs a cute routine
Feel a little patronized
Don't feel bad
They found a way inside your head
And you feel a bit misled
It's not that they don't care, yeah
The television's put a thought inside your head
Like a Barry Manilow, jingle
I'd like, to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
A symphonic blank stare, yeah
It doesn't make you care (make you care)
Not designed to make you care (make you care)
They're betting you won't care (you won't...)
Place a wager on your greed
A wager on your pride
Why try to beat them when, a million others tried?
We are the whore
Intellectually spayed
We are the queer
Dysfunctionally raised
One more pill to kill the pain
One more pill to kill the pain
One more pill to kill the pain
Living through conformity
One more prayer to keep me safe
One more prayer to keep us warm
One more prayer to keep us safe
There's gonna be a better place
Lost the battle, lost the war
Lost the things worth living for
Lost the will to win the fight
One more pill to kill the pain
Na na na na na
La na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
The going get tough, the tough get debt
Don't pay attention, pay the rent
Next of kins pay for your sins
A little faith should keep us safe
Save us
The human, existence
Is failing, resistance
Essential, the future
Written off, the odds are
Astronomically against us
Only moron and genius
Would fight a losing battle
Against the super ego
When giving in is so damn comforting
And so we go, on with our lives
We know the truth, but prefer lies
Lies are simple, simple is bliss
Why go against tradition when we can
Admit defeat, live in decline
Be the victim of our own design
The status quo, built on suspect
Why would anyone stick out their neck?
Fellow members of
Club ""We've Got Ours""
I'd like to introduce you to our host
He's got his, and I've got mine
Meet the decline
We are the queer
We are the whore
Ammunition
In the class war
We are worker
We love our queen
We sacrifice
We're soylent green
We are the queer
We are the whore
Ammunition

Leaving the coal calling the kettle black and orange and red

NOFX,Dinosaurs Will Die,Pump Up the Valuum,06/13/2000,"This is not a test of the emergency broadcast system, this is a real thing!
Kick back watch it crumble
See the drowning, watch the fall
I feel just terrible about it
That's sarcasm, let it burn!
I'm gonna make a toast when it falls apart
I'm gonna raise my glass above my heart
Then someone shouts, that's what they get
For all the the years of hit and run
For all the piss broke bands on VH-1
Where did all their money go?
Don't we all know?
Parasitic music industry
As it destroys itself
We'll show them how it's supposed to be
Music written from devotion
Not ambition, not for fame
Zero people are exploited
There are no tricks, up our sleeve
Were gonna fight against the mass appeal
Were gonna kill the seven record deal
Make records that have more than one good song
The dinosaurs will slowly die
And I do believe no one will cry
I'm just fucking glad I'm gonna be
There to watch the fall!
Pre-Historic music industry
Three feet in La Brea tar
Extinction never felt so good
If you think anyone will feel badly
You are sadly, mistaken
Time has come for evolution
Fuck collusion, kill by five
Whatever happened to the handshake
Whatever happened to deals no-one would break
What happened to, integrity
It's still there, it always was
For playing music just because
A million reasons why
All dinosaurs will die
All dinosaurs will die
All dinosaurs will die"
NOFX,Louise,Pump Up the Valuum,06/13/2000,"She gotta walk with a silicone cock
Sticking in her ass and one in her cunt
A butterfly vibrator strapped tight to her clit
But who's got the remote control
That would belong to Louise
She's got a new pet, a real vaginal tease
You know that mommy's little girl
Is not gonna do as she please
If she don't wanna get a spanking
She likes to speak like a six year old brat
Mommy discipline me, you know I've been bad
Start with a cat then she'll move to a crop
Neither one is willing to stop
She knows that girls just wanna have fun
With four piercings on each side of her labia
A little luggage lock connecting each one
Prevents her girl from going astray
Slut, you think you've seen your master mean?
You better lick my puss and asshole clean
Treat my clit like bubblegum
Bitch make me cum
It's time for bed she'll secure her head
Between her thighs for a thorough night suck
Along with this she'll be drinking her piss
So Louise don't have to get up
Twp goddesses in love
One resides below, one reigns from above
One adorns cuffs while one covets keys
The purgatorial touch of Louise"
NOFX,My Vagina,Pump Up the Valuum,06/13/2000,"My vagina has two sets of lips
But I don't get monthly blood drips
My vagina hardly even used
My vagina's got lots of extra skin
They took my outtie and made it an in
Changing Donnie to Marie Osmond
Operation, sex-cessful
But now I gotta pee through a miniature hole
Gotta remember to put the seat down
And when I wipe my ass, I go from front to back
Cause I don't want a bladder infection
I never thought I'd miss my vas deferens
I trade it in for a pair of used cans
Now I get to hang with lesbians
Operation, paid upfront
Now I show all my friends my new designer cunt
They think I'm kinda weird but that's okay with me
Cause now I kick their ass, playing from the ladies team
There's nothing finer than having a vagina"
Sum 41,Makes No Difference,Half Hour of Power,06/27/2000,"You're running fast and missing but can't help
Convincing
The reasons you gave me are all wearing thin
It's not meant to hurt you but let me assure
It's not what I said but intentions you've read

So when you hold onto the past then you
Will break down what little is left
There's nothing more you can't ignore
And say it makes no difference to me

Now that you're older life's weighing on your
Shoulders
You can't seem to keep things so perfectly straight
With most things so basic you might as well face it
You can't help but worry it's all just begun

So when you hold onto the past then you
Will break down what little is left
There's nothing more you can't ignore
And say it makes no difference to me

It makes no difference to me
It makes no difference to me
It makes no difference to me
It makes no difference

So when you hold onto the past then you
Will break down what little is left
There's nothing more you can't ignore
And say it makes no difference to me

I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

I never conquered, rarely came
16 just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault

I never conquered, rarely came
16 just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I could still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside

I was told of story of crushed velvet
Candle wax, and dried up flowers
The figure on the bed
All dressed up in roses, calling
Beckoning to sleep, offering a dream
Words were as mystical as purring animals
The circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared
The time was so tangible, I'll never let it go
Ghost stories handed down reached secret tunnels below
No one could see me
I fell into yesterday
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay
I fell into fantasy

And everyone was dancing
Nothing could touch us then, no one could change us then
Everyone was dancing
Nothing could hurt us then, no one could see us then

The only thing I ever had was you, it's true
And even when the times got hard you were there
To let us know that we'd get through
You showed me how to be a man
You taught me how to understand
The things people do
You showed me how to love my God
You taught me that not everyone
Knows the truth

And I thank you
I'll always thank you
More than you would know

We were sure to have a blast
For you it was just another Sunday
In a small Indiana town
I went by the place where you and I
Wrote our names in wet cement
And for a moment remembered how it felt
To have no one understand
That there's this dream
And they're not part of it
How soon we do forget
The house was gone
But the piano lingers on
And so does the fire that burned it to the ground
You can take away
All of my rights to see the day
But you can't take away my love for the day
Then there's the time that you took me aside
And said I was not your only son
Childhood is so fucked up
I never had any closer friends
Than the ones I had when I was young, alone again
Just you and I
Nostalgia, wave goodbye
I think it's time for me to go"

I used to have this friend
Who took his fiance
To see Billy Idol
A couple weeks before their wedding day
The chick got backstage
And left my friend outside
Next day she called from a hotel
Asking for a ride
I guess I'm giving up on love
I guess I'm giving up on love
I guess I'm giving up on love
'Cause it really kind of sucks
Uninspired
And growing tired
Why am I always
So attracted to drama?
So here I am
Grown up at 23
Will someone tell me
What it takes to be happy?
I play in my band
And write a lot of songs
About relationships
And how mine went wrong
Maybe I'll meet that special
Girl along the way
Then she'll break my heart
And leave me crying
I guess I'm giving up on love
I guess I'm giving up on love
I guess I'm giving up on love
'Cause it really kind of sucks
I guess I'm giving up on love
'Cause it really kind of sucks"
The Ataris,Hello and Goodbye,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"So long my friend
Don't say goodbye
Just give me one last kiss
Beneath this glowing sky
We'll go walking through the park
And hang out in the rain
Tell a joke and watch me smile
As we drink away the day
And know the next time that
You make a wish upon a star
I'll be wishing on the same one that you do
And every night I'm all alone
In some burn out highway town
I'll be thinking of the day that I met you
Hello again
It's been too long
What happened to our love
Since the last time I was gone?
I detach myself again
And lose something everytime
The solution's in the problem
Temporarily alright
And know the next time that
You make a wish upon a star
That sometimes it might actually come true
Our conversation can't consist of hello and goodbye
And the silence between saying I love you
And sometimes I wonder 'bout that too"
The Ataris,If You Really Want to Hear About It,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"Another lonely seaside town
Where the seasons closed it down
But if you close your eyes
You can almost hear the sounds of crowds gone by
Another year you'll all be here
Falling in love and watching sunsets and sunrises
It'll be grand and just what you planned till
Tomorrow comes and you've said your last goodbyes
He says he'll write, but he won't write
And you will waste your time
So stay the fuck home and greet everyone with goodbye
On this lonely winter's day
While all the crowds were still away
I realized the attraction
To temporary miles and holidays
Boardwalk dreams all boarded up
Another souvenir made to be broken
Chasing the sun isn't my kind of fun
I'd rather sit and catch snowflakes on my tongue
When summer's gone I won't be sad
As you cling on to all the good times that you've had
'Cause being alone isn't really all that bad
Don't ever tell anyone anything
Or else you'll wind up missing everybody
Don't ever tell anyone anything"
The Ataris,I.O.U. One Galaxy,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"Stars are out tonight
And you're the brightest one shining in my sky
It's like every wish I ever made came true
The day I woke up lying next to you
Will you be my best friend
If I offer you my heart?
'Cause it's already yours
We could hang out every night
And watch the sun go down
As long as we could watch it rise again
Gave me a valentine
It's these little things that stand the test of time
I've saved the tickets from the shows that we've been to
And a thousand other memories of you
Will you be my best friend
If I offer you my heart?
'Cause it's already yours
Gave you this I.O.U. today
It said, ""Good for one galaxy""
Once I build my rocket to the stars
We'll fly away, just you and me"
The Ataris,Song #13,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"The time has come to say goodbye to all our past regrets
I'm sorry to inform you, but I doubt you'll really ever understand
Friendships aren't built on false promises
I've failed without defeat
In this game of disrespect
I'm a victim, a small town tragedy
Here's the difference between you and I
I'll tell the truth and count my blessings
So thanks for all you've done
But I won't let you get the best of me
You think I'm just a kid
But you don't fucking get it
I'm strong in my convictions
And don't you forget it
So many things are left unsaid
But I won't even waste my time
For us to go our separate ways
I hope you miss me when I'm gone
Friendships aren't built on false promises
I've failed without defeat
In this game of disrespect
I'm a victim of small town rivalry
You think I'm just a kid but
You don't fucking get it
I'm strong in my convictions
And don't you forget it
Here's the difference between you and I
I'll tell the truth and count my blessings
So thanks for all you've done
But I won't let you get the best of me
Farewell to all my friends
With self respect intact
Nothing will last forever
Never looking back
End is forever"
The Ataris,Summer Wind Was Always Our Song,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"These break-up songs make sense again
And I really wish they didn't
Sinatra's singing ""Summer Wind""
And I'm thinking of the night we met
Just one last time
Can I hear you say
You're my little boy
I never want you to go away
Where are you?
Please believe in me
I'm not hanging up the phone
Till I hear you say
""I love you
I need you near""
Just give me one last chance
And I'll never let you down again
Oh and what i wouldn't give
Just to kiss your lips again
To hold your hand next to my heart
And wake up with you in your apartment
Just one last time
Can I call you my sweetheart?
My best friend
Why do all good things come to an end?"
The Ataris,Teenage Riot,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"Three years gone by
And still everyone screws up our name
No matter what you do, still some things never change
Seen a lot of the world, met a lot of friends
Got a lot of fond memories
There's nothing like playing a basement show
On a Saturday night in Pennsylvania
Start the show, here we go
Jumping in the crowd
We've gotta tear this building down
The cops show up as usual
To try and ruin our fun
It's time to show 'em all
Just how it's done
Gonna have a teenage riot
They'll never understand
What it's like to be a kid today
Gonna have a teenage riot
Let's blow 'em all away
Another night we'll be
Staying in some crack hotel
And sneaking everyone in through the bathroom window
Gonna blow up everything in sight
And get chased away into the night
By some crazy bastard with a shotgun in his hand
Start the show, here we go
Jumping in the crowd
We've gotta tear this building down
The cops show up as usual
And try to ruin our fun
It's time to tell them all to fuck off
Gonna have a teenage riot
They'll never understand
What it's like to be a kid today
Gonna have a teenage riot
It's gonna start today"
The Ataris,"Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start",End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"Today was a good day
I didn't even have to use my AK
At least I didn't get my heart broken anyway
Wasting time in east New Jersey
Guess I could tell you 'bout
The snow covered rooftops
Sunsets, shooting stars, and picturesque backdrops
Or how I went and hung out at Quick Stop
And pretended that I was in Clerks
Sometimes you gotta stop and remember
That you're not gonna live forever
Be young, think smart
Stay true and just follow your heart
Remember the times we watched Karate Kid
And memorized every line
Skipped school and went to the arcade
Hung out and played Galaga all day
Stole a car and we drove to Michigan
Six hundred miles with no destination
Except to get in the car and drive
And see where we'll end up
Sometimes you gotta stop and remember
That you're not gonna be young forever
Think smart, have fun
Stay true and don't ever grow up
Out of all I've learned in life
You always keep your friends close to your heart
'Cause who will help you if you're falling down
And everything is okay
And everything is okay
And everything is okay
And everything is okay"
The Ataris,You Need a Hug,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"Maybe you should work for Sick of It All
Or get a job with the L.A.P.D
Did someone switch your Ritalin with ephedrine?
Just don't take your fucking problems out on me
I'd buy you a little fuzzy bunny
I'd put you on my Christmas card list
If you'd promise not to take your job so seriously
And realize you don't have to be so pissed
Fuck you, dick
Life ain't all that bad, life ain't all that bad
Even if Henry Rollins is your dad
Life ain't all that bad, life ain't all that bad
Buck up, little camper, don't be sad
Maybe you could go hunting with Ted Nugent
And see how many animals you could kill
I'd pay all of my friends just to hang out with you
And take you out to Sizzler for a meal
I'd take you to my favorite karaoke bar
And you sing ""Let the Sunshine In""
You could stomp my ass into oblivion
But that doesn't mean I'll put up with your shit
Life ain't all that bad, life ain't all that bad
Even if Henry Rollins is your dad
Life ain't all that bad, life ain't all that bad
Buck up, little camper, don't be sad

The Ataris,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,Let It Burn,02/06/2001,"Got out of bed today
I'm alive, what can I say?
I'm really happy to be
Somewhere with someone who makes me happy
I took the bus downtown
All day long I walked around
I looked at all the sights
And thought about how lucky I am now
I was sick of feeling down
So I gave it all away
Two thousand miles from all I know
And so much better off today
I'm still waiting for the world
To come crashing down again
And I'm still waiting for someone
To call me up and tell me you're dead
Sometimes I wonder what was going through your head
I don't know, but I won't go there again
You make me smile so wide
When I look into your eyes
When you're not around
You know you're somewhere stuck inside my mind
So here I am today
I was lost for twenty years
I found clarity
The day I took a chance
And moved away
I was sick of feeling down
So I gave it all away
Two thousand miles from all I know
And so much better off today
But I'm still waiting for the world
To come crashing down again
I'm still waiting for someone
To call me up and tell me you're dead
And sometimes I wonder what was going through your head
I don't know, but I won't go there again
No, I won't go there again"
The Ataris,Song for a Mix Tape,Let It Burn,02/06/2001,"Today I made you a mix tape
And I decorated it with lots of stars
It had all my favorite songs
There was Jawbreaker and Armchair Martain
Built to Spill and the Descendents
Hell, I even put one of ours on it
Falling for you was the easy thing to do
If only somehow I could make you hang around
Today I made you a mix tape
To say exactly how I feel inside
And make you feel it too
These are the songs that make me smile
And cry myself to sleep at night
When I'm lying without you
I love you more than I ever loved anyone before
Hey, silly girl, I'm begging you
All of these songs they remind me of you
I hope that you like this song
Did you ever listen to the words and melody
Do you feel the pain inside
The way that it hurts me?
When you're in your room at night
I hope you'll be singing along
And make me a tape of your favorite songs"
Tsunami Bomb,Invasion From Within,The Invasion From Within!,02/27/2001,"Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
I'm caught! I cannot kick them out
Their claws are wrapped around my throat and they are squeezing tighter
Insanity is coming over me
Their every wish is my command
No way out!
I feed them, you will too!
They're gonna take control of you!
You'll know when they have got you trapped
Everything looks cloudy and you feel like you're on fire
Inhabited, I wish that I was dead
My blood has turned from red to black
No way out!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
When they come for you
They see right through your flesh and bones for soon you'll be their home
They know you deep inside, the things you can't try to hide
No hope after the first bite
Look out, 'cause they are onto you
They'll cut you open, crawl inside and you'll be lost forever
Don't try to run 'cause you're the chosen one
Your world is gone, no turning back
No way out!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy!"
Tsunami Bomb,Lemonade,The Invasion From Within!,02/27/2001,"Look at you now
Remember how you gave me shit
And I made lemonade out of it
Pass me the sugar and things still won't be right
Look what you've built
Now are you proud of your deceitful quilt?
Well I won't cover myself in it
The warmth has just been choking me

Now what do you say?
Can't hear you buried in the lies that you've laid
I'm breaking myself away from that chain
Too bad that you don't understand why
I'm walkin' away
And if you're lucky then someday I may
Possibly forgive you for all of it
But not today
But not today!


Thanks, thanks for nothing
I've taken all you got and started walking (I'm walking)
Not broken! Still standing!
Been ripped apart but now
I'm demanding
No more shit
This is it
I'm leaving for myself and no one else
So long!
Been swell!
See you in hell!

Last time now!

Now you're back to who you were before!
Marionette who are you now? (WHOO-OH, WHOO-OH)

Tsunami Bomb,No Good Very Bad Day,The Invasion From Within!,02/27/2001,"Why is it me? This is not my day
I burnt myself with coffee and my brand new doggie ran away
How can it be? I cannot believe
I don't have any money and I have to pay the bills today
I wish that I could run away
Myself esteem is low At losing I'm a pro
But there is one thing that I know
It'd all be good if I could just stay home
What should I do?
He told me ""I Hate you!""
I don't know where to live next year and my guitar won't stay in tune
Where should I go? I am so all alone
I broke my new computer and nobody calls me on the phone
I wish I weren't so accident prone"
Tsunami Bomb,No One's Looking,The Invasion From Within!,02/27/2001,"No sense trying to impress faces emotionless
Contact with others is unheard of
When you bump into me there's no apology
What is it that you're so afraid of?
You're staring straight through me
When will we gain back the trust we've been breaking?
How can we stop all the clocks we've been racing?
Thought that we had grown, now we're all alone
Seems that time isn't all that we're wasting
What are you gonna do if I try to talk to you
Walking away won't solve your problem
Can't you be a human being and show common courtesy?
A cold shoulder isn't what I'm here for
Does anybody care?"
Tsunami Bomb,Not Forever,The Invasion From Within!,02/27/2001,"I thought that this was solid
Stability and safety sitting in my hand
Just take a look at your life
You're all alone
Who'll be there when I need someone
Count on nobody and no one will let you down
I don't care. Just let me go
I don't need this anymore
Love is not forever
Friendship is not forever
There is nothing set in stone
You're on your own
Who'll be there when I need someone
Count on nobody and no one will let you down
I don't care. Just let me go
I don't need this anymore
I don't need this anymore
Dependence is followed by weakness
Don't be your own hostage
If I know so many, why don't they know me?
They don't know me
Just! Just take a look at your life!
You're all alone!
Now I know what we're made of
Confusion, complication, and uncertainty
I thought this was real, I was wrong
So I don't know
Who'll be there when I need someone
Count on nobody and no one will let you down
I don't care. Just let me go
I don't need this anymore
Who'll be there when I have no one
Don't expect that anyone will go out of their way
I don't care that I'm all alone
I don't need this anymore"
Good Charlotte,Little Things,Good Charlotte,03/27/2001,"Yeah, this song is dedicated (this is Good Charlotte) to every kid who ever got picked last in gym class (y'know what I'm saying, this is for you)
To every kid who never had a date to no school dance (this is for you)
To everyone who's ever been called a freak (come with me)
Here we, here we go
What? (y'all know what I'm saying)
This is for you, (what?) here we, here we go

Like the time in school when we got free lunch and the cool kids beat us up (reduced lunch!)
And the rich kids had convertibles and we had to ride the bus (fifty-five)
Like the time we made the baseball team, but they still laughed at us (you still suck)
Like the time that girl broke up with me cause I wasn't cool enough
Trick!

Things...
The little things, little things they always hang around
The little things, little things they try to break me down
The little things, little things they just won't go away
The little things, little things made me who I am today
You want to hate me now
But I won't stop know, cause I can't stop now
What? Come on. Ungh
Here we go

Like the time mom went to that institute cause she was breaking down (I just can't take it!)
Like the car we had that wouldn't start, we had to walk to get around (Can I get a ride?)
And that same year on Christmas Eve, Dad went to the store (uh, I'll see you guys later)
We checked his room, his things were gone
We didn't see him no more
Dick!

Things...
The little things, little things they always hang around
The little things, little things they try to break me down
The little things, little things they just won't go away
The little things, little things made me who I am today
You want to hate me now
But I won't stop know, cause I can't stop now
It always seems those little things they take the biggest part of me...

And I know that those little things they make the biggest part of me break down
I'm breaking down
Break down
Gotta maintain"
Alkaline Trio,Armageddon,From Here to Infirmary,04/03/2001,"I wrote the words to this song on the back of a photograph
Behind your back it goes
A little something like this is way too big to miss
I got a letter in the mail
The sender failed to let me know where it came from
Opened it up and sure enough, there we were, arm in arm again

I know it's small but my last call's been called, half an hour ago
I know it's late but do you think you could at least fix it for me?
Then I'll go, I'll go alone
I swear I won't tell a soul
I'll drink this beer and write in fear of a song everybody hates

Armageddon, let the light in
Before we say goodbye, give us something to believe in
Armageddon, we're not begging
For too much, I don't think
Need a goodbye kiss before we sink

Am I waking up at all today?
Seeing lights, feeling pain, there's my cure on ice
I can walk but I will crawl there
I will crawl there
Sitting straight, feeling faint, an exhausted smile
Screens my words but I will hear them
Here's a phrase that we all know, but I can't make sense
I don't know words but I will hear them
I still hear them
Never ran away for the sake of scars
Tried not to move but she was armed
And shots were fired
Now a hole in the head of this wounded liar
Never had a drink that I didn't like
Got a taste of you, threw up all night
I got more sick
With every sour second rate kiss
Everything I never would miss again

Alkaline Trio,Hell Yes,From Here to Infirmary,04/03/2001,"I gave up on you a long time ago
How can you blame me?
We made plans to meet and you never showed
You kept me waiting
They said everything would work out just fine
They said you'd help me
But as it turns out it was all a lie
And they're off someplace far away laughing at me
You've been there for me one time in my life
But it didn't matter
You came and went so fast all my hope
And faith in you shattered
And now here I sit alone in this room
No one to confide in
You watched all my dreams come apart at the seams
You laughed, you left, you waited in hiding

Bless me dark father I have sinned
I've done it before and I'll do it again
Cause it keeps me warm, and makes you smile
Been beneath me all the while
Hell yes

You gave up on me along time ago
I can't say I blame you
I rejected the faith in your holy rays
Is what it comes down to
They said everything would work out just fine
I just went crazy
But I'm better now having a good time
Being selfish, and drunken, and vulgar, and lazy

Bless me dark father I can't win
Without you I'm as good as dead
Cause you keep me warm, you make me smile
You've been on my shoulder all the while
Whispering sweet nothings
Whispering sweet nothings
Whispering sweet nothings
You've been whispering sweet nothings"
Alkaline Trio,Mr. Chainsaw,From Here to Infirmary,04/03/2001,"When was it that you lost your youth or traded
It for something more for them to use, so jaded
Why is it that you never said
I love you more than just a friend?
I pray this gridlock never ends
And when we get there just depends
I found out recently that you are leaving
For good I hope I softly tell my ceiling
It's better now to be alive
Sleeping is my 9 to 5
I'm having nightmares all the time
Of running out of words that rhyme
Everything that you could never say
Would never matter anyway
I took a hammer and two nails to my eardrums long ago
Before that steak knife took my eyes
I looked up to the sky
For the last thing I would ever see
For the last time I'd cry
When was it that you sold your life or wasted
Every bite of that small slice you never tasted?
I guess I should be one to talk
There's nights that I can't even walk
There's days I couldn't give a fuck
And in between is where I'm stuck
From blocks away I heard somebody screaming
That small child inside of you that you left bleeding
You stabbed him up not once but twice
Cubicles will now suffice
Some say it's the roll of the dice
I think they're wrong, I know I'm right
Every breath that I could barely breathe
Could barely make it past my teeth
I took a blowtorch to both of my lungs a long, long time ago
And every step that I could take
Is one more difficult to make
Mr. Chainsaw came and took my legs a long, long time ago
In case you're wondering, I'm singing about growing up, about giving in
In case you're wondering, I'm singing about growing up, about giving in
In case you're wondering, we're singing about growing up
About growing up and giving in"
Alkaline Trio,Private Eye,From Here to Infirmary,04/03/2001,"I dragged this lake looking for corpses
Dusted for prints, pried up the floorboards
Pieces of planes and black box recorders
Don't lie
And I've been preoccupied with these sick, sixth senses
That sense DNA on barbed wire fences
Maybe someday I'll find me a suspect
That has no alibi

But at the right place at the right time
I'll be dead wrong and you'll be just fine
And I won't have to quit doing fucked up shit
For anyone but me
And at the right place at the right time
It will have been worth it to stand in line
And you won't have to stop
Saying ""I love cops"" for anyone but me
Your private eye

New Year's Eve was as boring as heaven
I watched flies fuck on channel 11
There was no one to kiss, there was nothing to drink
Except some old rotten milk someone left in the sink
And there's no ring on the phone anymore
There's no reason to call I passed out on the floor
Smoked myself stupid and drank my insides raisin dry"
Alkaline Trio,Stupid Kid,From Here to Infirmary,04/03/2001,"There are things that used to make me smile
One of them was you for just a little while
You left me for dead so far away
I replaced you with fear and shame
You'll be happy on the day I die

There are things that used to make me laugh
But now they're deeply buried in the past
I left them there so far away
Replaced my humor with my pain
I'll be happy on the day it dies

Remember when I said I love you
Well, forget it I take it back
I was just a stupid kid back then
I take back every word that I said

There are things that used to make you cry
One of them was me for just a little while
Why is it that you had to say
Goodbye in your special way
You slashed the tires on my car"

See, I don't know if you can help me or not
Cause I don't feel sick, no I don't feel sick
But the pains in my head have almost put me underground
I don't really care if I am healthy or not
Just clean my head up, doc, I'll give you anything you want
See, I don't know why I don't fall in love
Well, maybe I know why, and maybe you could make it stop
We'll cut it up and bury it and leave it underground
And I'll take to wishing and fall under sleeping safe and sound
Just give me medicine, prescribe me anything
Just knock me out and walk me through the door
Well I have no desire
To see through my own eyes anymore
Hello, what the hell are you doing here?
You made a really strange face, this is a really uncomfortable air
I see I'm boring you, maybe I bore myself too
That's why I need help, I'm cleaning blood off dusty shelves
I've been cut up in this room so many times it might take days
And those stress cracks in the wood, how nicely they soak up the stains
Just give me medicine, prescribe me anything
Just knock me out and walk me through the door
Well I have no desire
To see through my own eyes anymore
Been telling myself these jokes for so long, well so long
I'm a has-been who is heckled on the stage
Been telling myself these jokes for so long, well so long
I'm a has-been who is heckled on this stage"
NOFX,Fun Things To Fuck (If You're A Winner),Surfer,04/10/2001,"Fun things to fuck
Fun things to fuck (fuck)
Fun things to fuck
Fun things to fuck

Fuck the front door
Fuck the back
Fuck the good girls with the knack
Fuck the government
Until they fuck you back
Fuck a muslim, fuck a jew
Fuck fans of Blink-182
That's illegal if you're born in '83
Yeah yeah yeah
Fuck a bean and cheese burrito
Fuck a bowl of cookie dough
Fuck the space between the big and neighbor toe
Fuck a cop
Fuck a machine
Fuck a jar of Vaseline
Fuck a calzone with pepperoni

Fuck a midget
Fuck a dwarf
Fuck Kris Kringle with an elf
But before you fuck it all
Go fuck yourself"
Sum 41,Fat Lip,All Killer No Filler,04/22/2001,"Storming through the party like my name was El Ni'o
When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino
As a kid
I was a skid
And no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party
'Cause nobody came

I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never going, never showing up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearing ""act your age""

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down

Because you don't
Know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

'Cause we like having fun at other peoples expense and
Cutting people down is just a minor offense then
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down

Don't count on me, to let you know when
Don't count on me, I'll do it again
Don't count on me, it's the point you're missing
Don't count on me, 'cause I'm not listening

Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat (Back-packed!)
And I don't give a shit about nothing
You be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing
Then if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringing off the hook
You're on the hit list, (wanted!) in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom should have had an abortion

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down
Waste my time with them
Casualty of society
Waste my time again
Victim of your conformity
And back down"
The Bouncing Souls,Better Life,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"Wait for the morning light to sneak up with the sunrise
Last night was so long ago, where did the hours go?
I saw the first daylight shining in your eyes
You were mine and the world was ours
Dreams of a better life can come true
It's all there in you
Just like a break in the clouds when the sun comes shining through
Momentary glimpse of the divine sometimes when I look at you
And everything just cancels out
And for that moment there's no doubt
Dreams of a better life can come true
It's all there in you
Sometimes a new day can bring a new beginning
You took me to a place no time can erase
Yesterday I was a loser, today I'm winning
Today you're mine and the world is ours
Dreams of a better life can come true
It's all there in you
Dreams of a better life can come true
It's all there in you"
The Bouncing Souls,Break-Up Song,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"""I don't want this anymore"" is all I heard her say
As I grabbed my stuff and headed out the door
With my music in my phones and my bike under my feet
Things started to look different as I got out on the street
Sometimes I see her face
In the new people that I meet
We're not who we thought we were
When we saw this dream
Sometimes when I just can't sleep
I hear the words you said to me
How did you get so deep inside of me?
I wake up and I move on, admit the past is gone
I wake up and I refine
Moving forward to the next lifetime
I leave it all behind
Sometimes when I just can't sleep
I hear the words you said to me
Sometimes it takes a painful loss
To realize you are free
How did you get so deep inside of me?
How did you get so deep inside of me?"
The Bouncing Souls,Broken Record,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"Going to the same old places, skipping like a broken record
I love you all, but I gotta get out and change this scenery
I've got to find what I'm living for
I've got to change this life that I'm living
Nowhere to run from myself
Nowhere to hide from the truth
I tried to find someone, someone who knew
Somebody to give myself to
I learned the hard way, when you give yourself away
You give away your life too
Nowhere to run from myself
Nowhere to hide from the truth
I tried to find someplace that seemed right for me
I walked the streets until I lost my mind
And that was the best place to be
When I lost my mind the truth set me free"
The Bouncing Souls,Gone,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"It was a cloudy night, or so it looked to me
I felt so lost, I couldn't say why
I needed strength to change my mind, but these ghosts stick to me like glue
Hating life, believing I was no good
It was a darkness all my own
A song played on the radio
It went straight to my heart
I carried it with me until the darkness was gone
It was a cloudy night, or so it looked to me
I felt so lost, I couldn't say why
I built this cloud to live in, it was a bunch of lies in my mind
The world wants me to believe it, so I had to change my mind
It was a darkness all my own
A song played on the radio
It went straight to my heart
I carried it with me until the darkness was gone
I built this cloud, I can break it
The world can't change how I feel
Because I know it's a lie
My heart is real"
The Bouncing Souls,Late Bloomer,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"I saw you walking past me just the other day
Another heartbeat with thoughts of yesterday
You looked the same, years are only time
I still wonder why our hearts could never rhyme
You stood beside me, you didn't recognize me
Funny how some things never change
And when you walked on by a memory surprised me
Smoking cigarettes with your girlfriends by the pool
Your smell I could not forget, that's as close as I could get
You were so fucking cool
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
All I wanted was a piece of your heart
You left me torn apart
Fuck the rest before me and their crimes
For your love I'll serve their time
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?"
The Bouncing Souls,Lifetime,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"Just like a sunny day can turn all dark and gray, this game goes on and on
Out on the streets, broken dreams, they come so cheap
No one can leave me for dead, I've got one good fight left in me tonight
And the most beautiful girl in my head
Sometimes she comes to me in a song
Sometimes she comes in a dream
She's all the joy in my heart
She's everything that I see
Days they come and days go by, sometimes we fight and I don't know why
I'll give it all up to her
Everything I did and said, I've got all I want now in my sight
And the most beautiful girl in my head
Sometimes she comes to me in a song
Sometimes she comes in a dream
She's all the joy in my heart
She's everything that I see
When we're together, there is no time, there is no space
When we're together, everything is in its place
Turn myself inside-out for her, my endless love is without form
Let my heart be the light that guides her through the storm
Tomorrow's a lifetime away
She's all I want today
Tomorrow's a lifetime away
She's all I want today"

Well, I like to rock and I love to roll
When the music's runnin' through my soul
I got no, no place to go
But my own private radio
I met a lot of people that made me feel alright
And the music's got me through the night
Go!

Well, I had a drink and I had a smoke
I listened to every word you spoke
Another story, another memory
Another day the way things should be

If I had it my way, everyone would know

Some of them split, some of them stay
Some of them walk, some walk on by

From all these people I've tried to learn
Some of them shine, some of them burn
Some of them rise, some of them fall
But good or bad, I've known them all
We live our life in our own way
Never really listened to what they say
The kind of faith that doesn't fade away
We are the true believers
We are the true believers
Well, you can fight or you can run
Hide under a rock 'til the war is won
Play it safe and don't make a sound
But not us, we won't back down
True believers all the way
You and I
We live our life in our own way
Never really listened to what they say
The kind of faith that doesn't fade away

The Bouncing Souls,Manthem,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"I was alone, I decided to get up, decided to get out
I picked up the phone and I gave my boys a shout
Told them I'd be out around nine, no particular plan
Just whatever comes to mind
Bryan called me up, said there's a show tonight
Do you want to go tonight, I'm giving my girl the night off
'Cause I'm hanging out with Steinkopf
Whenever I'm down, I know where my friends can be found
Whenever there's a doubt, I just have to shout
He's my friend, he's my alibi
My accessory to the crime
A bond that will never die
Until the end of time
Another night and we got somewhere to go
Going out, meeting up at the punk rock show
Where the air is hot and the music is loud
My kind of place, this is my kind of crowd
And we'll be here 'til the night is through
Loyal to my friends and sworn to fun
He's my friend, he's my alibi
My accessory to the crime
A bond that will never die
Until the end of time"

The rhythm hit, it got my movement off the ground
Soundtrack of what I want to be
If I want to change the world, it's gotta start with me
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
And in the end what have we learned?
Are we just faces in the crowd?
I died and was reborn again today
Hold fast to myself, make these good feelings stay
We laughed, we cried
The music shaped our lives
So tell me why our movement's out of time?
Are we so out of line?
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again

We stand tonight, hearts in our hands"

Laws that rule the school and workplace

We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're fucked up, you're to blame

Let this train wreck burn more slowly
Kids are victims in this story
Drown our youth with useless warnings
Teenage rules, they're fucked and boring

Forget when I
Don't meet expectations

You weren't the only one, two, three, four

Why do you still keep it around
When you know it brings me down?
I'm hating everything
And I know that you dated other guys
But I got to wonder why
You'd leave it out for me

Why am I still hanging around
When I know it brings me down?
I'm hating everything
And you are getting rides home in his car
You're making out in his front yard
I'm hating everything

Put your past behind me

I've got so much left to say
I'd tell you everything

Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there

She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it, I swear

Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
17 without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin' explanation

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance, I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window

Saves the Day,All I'm Losing Is Me,Stay What You Are,07/10/2001,"The moon hangs like the blade of an axe tonight
And it's poised to drop sometime soon enough
On this dump truck where I lie
Mixed up with the morning's trash
There's a piece of glass sticking in my back
And tar covering my mouth

But it's okay 'cause I'm still breathing
And my hands are free of the heap

And I think that I see that big blade falling
And I think that I see that big blade coming

And the pressure is getting to me
And the waste in which I sit is just lurking beside me
And I can't tell if it's me or the meat that's rotting
I'm gonna have to give up sometime soon

But it's okay 'cause I'm still breathing
And my hands are free of the heap

And I think that I see that big blade falling
And I think that I see that big blade coming

You can watch me disappear
You can watch me
All I'm losing is me
All I'm losing is me
(You can watch me disappear)
All I'm losing is me
(You can watch me disappear)
All I'm losing is me

To slice open a great canyon
Through the earth you can watch me disappear"
Saves the Day,As Your Ghost Takes Flight,Stay What You Are,07/10/2001,"The last time that I saw you, August of '99
I should've had my hammer and a few rusty spikes
To nail you on a wall and use bottles to catch your blood
Display you for the neighbors so they'd know your time had come

And I'd drink your blood
Feel it dripping down my throat
And heading for my heart

And as your body sags and the stench rises in vain
The people on the street are collecting in dismay
Before their eyes, your head lifts towards the sky
And that's the last thing they'll remember of you

Cause I'd drink your blood
Feel it dripping down my throat
And heading for my heart

You've become a ghost
You're floating somewhere in between
The waking world and a landscape of dreams
Well it is nothing but dying
Got a grenade stuck in your teeth and you're pulling at the pin
You're an illusion, just a shadow flickering underneath the sun

And I'd drink your blood
Feel it dripping down my throat
And heading for my heart"

You're two floors down getting high in the back room
If I flooded out your house, do you think you'd make it out?
Or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs?
And at your funeral I will sing the requiem

This song will become the anthem of your underground
You're two floors down getting high in the back room
If I flooded out your house, do you think you'd make it out?
Or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs?

And at your funeral I will sing the requiem
I'd offer you my hand
It would hurt too much to watch you die

And you can bet that when we mourn the death of you that night
They'll lay me on the dinner table, I will be the pig
With the apple in my mouth, the food that celebrates your end

And at your funeral I will sing the requiem
I'd offer you my hand
It would hurt too much to watch you die
And at your funeral I will sing the requiem
I'd offer you my hand
It would hurt too much to watch you die"
Saves the Day,Cars & Calories,Stay What You Are,07/10/2001,"Her life was magazines and faithful TV screens
Selling an empty dream of cars and calories
Everything in between the sun and Saturn's ring
The price tag can't be seen

And it took bites out of her insides
'Til she was just a hollow shell

Grew up in east L.A
Watching celebrities
Living out all her dreams
The plastic canopy of U.S. royalty
Drew her gaze towards the sky
Away from her own mind

And it took bites out of her insides
'Til she was just a hollow shell

And at her home her mother cried
'Cause daddy had something on the side
They didn't look up when she sighed

When August came around
Bathing suits on the ground
Replaced by a cotton cloak
To see her own reflection was like squinting in the sun
And when all tomorrow brings is a set of broken wings

Well it takes bites out of your insides
'Til you are just a hollow shell
And it took bites out of her insides
'Til she was just a hollow shell"

And buy a bucket full of diamonds
But even the most beautiful of all roses
Must someday crumble to dust and fade away
It's certain tragedy

So, it's on into the lonely nights and all the rest of it
The empty space between me and the sunken walls
And feeling someone's hand around my neck
Choking away the life that I have left

And I can finally see that the further I go
I'm only treading ground I don't want to know
I'll probably hang upside down
From wooden rafters in my home
And look at old photos of you

So, it's on into the lonely nights and all the rest of it
The empty space between me and the sunken walls
And feeling someone's hand around my neck
Choking away the life that I have left

I miss the warmth of the summer
When we were on our own
But now it's winter and my bones are cold

And now I finally see that the further we go
We're only treading ground that we already know

After our third round
Of pouring whiskey down
The barrel of our guts
Grab hold of your hand

And we're yelling through the streets
And I'm out of my fucking mind

And I know you're next to me
But I must confess
What's in my head

Keep pumping now
Legs to beat the ground
And our hearts to beat the band
Sky's on fire again
Run down this alleyway
Lightning bolts again
We become fireflies
Just flashing at the ends
Rattle garbage cans
Prepare to be ravaged
By our lust, burning mad
To find that we've become

And I know you're under me
But I must confess
What's in my head

To me you are the light
From a light bulb  breaks sometimes
And the tender warmth inside
Is released into my life
To me you are the light
From a light bulb  breaks sometimes
And the tender warmth inside
Is released into my life

And it smothers me in flames
That lick and scorch my face
As the smoke reaches the sky
Know I'm burning tonight
Know I'm burning tonight
Know I'm burning tonight
Know I'm burning tonight
Know I'll burn for you tonight"

Slide under the back door
Rendering me freakish and dazed

Well, here I am
Don't know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when you're around me
To shut me out

So I'll go walking in the streets
'Til my heels bleed
And I'll sing out my song
In case the birds wish to sing along
And I'll dig a tunnel to the center of the universe

Well, here I am
Don't know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when you're around me
To shut me out

I'll make my way across the frozen sea
Beyond the blank horizon
Where I can forget you and me
And get a decent night's sleep

Well, here I am
Don't know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when you're around me
To shut me out
Well, here I am
Don't know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when you're around me
To shut me out

To shut me out

For whatever mood you're in

Isn't that what you expect?
I can sing you to sleep

Got a mouth full of blood
And I'll carry this casket if it's what I have to do
So, bring on the dark sky
Let it cover me entirely

Isn't that what you expect?
I can sing you to sleep
And all you want from me
Is a broken heart

And I'll run down to the river
Grab five buckets of water
Wait right where you are
And I will serve you at your table
Hope you like my restaurant
And the lighting is right
The jukebox is in the corner
My mouth is the speaker
And it plays your favorite songs
And you know where the coin slot is

Isn't that what you expect?
I can sing you to sleep
And all you want from me
Is a broken heart
Isn't that what you expect?
I can sing you to sleep
And all you want from me
Is a broken heart
A broken heart"
Saves the Day,Nightingale,Stay What You Are,07/10/2001,"And I will flail under these lights
That seep down from the bitter sky tonight
And I will kick and beat my wrists together
And feel an ocean breathing waves
Feel them licking at my face
Ceilings don't exist
And there are no floors beneath me
If I were king of this night
Would you become my queen?

And I hope, your majesty
That you like your position
I'll do everything I can
To keep you by my side
And I'll stare off through the darkness
To find us a kingdom
Just kiss me before I go

I'll have to walk a thousand miles
Just to find the ground deserving of your feet
You could throw me down
And walk on me
And I'd just look on through my love
And through the haze

And I hope, your majesty
That you like your position
I'll do everything I can
To keep you by my side
And I'll stare off through the darkness
To find us a kingdom
Just kiss me before I go

The nightingales are singing loud
They're calling out our marriage
To our subjects on their knees
Their jewelry is thrown into the air
They sigh at the release
As their shackles hit the ground
The trumpets call out now
We're home at last

And I hope, your majesty
That you like your position
I'll do everything I can
To keep you by my side
And I'll stare off through the darkness
To find us a kingdom
Just kiss me before I go"
Saves the Day,See You,Stay What You Are,07/10/2001,"My gut is burning
Won't you find me some water?
Hey, just forget it can you bring me gasoline?
Collect a couple forks
Hold them three feet apart
Wait for lightning to strike to burn me up

'Cause I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today

My head is swirling
Been carried off in the sky
And where it lands is where it lands
I guess that I will get another head
Then get on with my life
Leave you somewhere beneath the waves of time
And I'll wear glass shoes and plastic wrap
No, I'll just wear my insides
You want to know who I really am?
Yeah, so do I
Yeah, so do I

'Cause I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today
And I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today
Right now, I am turning off the lights
'Cause I don't think
I have got the stomach to stomach calling you today
And I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today
I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today"
Saves the Day,This Is Not an Exit,Stay What You Are,07/10/2001,"Tonight will be the night that we begin to ease the plugs out of the dam
And we will stand knee deep in the flow
The undertow will grab our heels and won't let go
And while we hold, our legs quivering
The water rises now to our teeth when we just let go

And sail belly up to the clouds, the rocks scraping our backs
To breathe in the air will be the only thing that we have

And all the wasted nights and empty moments in our lives
Are flushed away as we sway with the rhythm of the waves bobbing us up
Crests fall to troughs as we feel our gills open up

And sail belly up to the clouds, the rocks scraping our backs
To breathe in the air will be the only thing that we have

And if the hook sets in the bottom of our lungs
We'll rip it out and lick the blood off with our tongues

Despair can ravage you if you turn your head around
To look down the path that's lead you here, cause what can you change?
You're a vessel now floating down the waterways
You can take your rudder and aim your ship
Just don't bother with the things left in your wake

Just sail belly up to the clouds, the rocks scraping your back
To breathe in the air will be the only thing that you have
And your love will be warm nights with pockets of moonlight
Spotlighting you as you drift, the actor in this play
And you walk across the stage, take a bow, hear the applause
And as the curtain falls, just know you did it all
The best that you knew how and you can hear them cheering now
So let a smile out and show your teeth cause you know you lived it well"

Then only to pretend

Don't you know I'm thinking (know I'm thinking)
Driving 405 past midnight
You know I miss you (don't you know that I miss you?)
Ninth and Ash on a Tuesday night
I would write to you from Museum Mile
A toast to you: your whisper, your smile
Up the stairs at Weatherford
A ghost each place I hide

Would you mean this please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?
Won't you get your story straight
If you don't know, honey, why'd you just say so?
'Cause I need this now more than I ever did
If you don't well, honey, then you don't

I left you waiting (I know I left you waiting)
At the least could we be friends?
Should have never started (never started)
Ain't that the way it always ends?
On my life I'll try today
There's so much I've felt I should say but
Even if your heart would listen
I doubt I could explain

If you don't well, honey, then you don't
If you don't well, honey, then you don't


So here we are now
A sip of wine a sip of water
Someday maybe
Maybe someday we'll be smarter
And I'm sorry that I'm such a mess
I drank all my money could get and
Took everything you let me have
And then I never loved you back

If you don't don't know, why would you say so?
Would you mean the please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?
Won't you get your story straight?
If you don't know, honey, why'd you just say so?

I waited 'til 11

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me
Tonight

And maybe when the night is dead
I'll crawl into my bed
I'm staring at these four walls again
I'll try to think about the last time I had a good time
Everyone's got somewhere to go
And they're gonna leave me here on my own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me

What the hell is wrong with me?
Don't fit in with anybody
How did this happen to me?

This house is haunted, it's so pathetic, it makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say, the words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home, I'd read it every day

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost
It's not right

Their anger hurts my ears, been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems, they never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday, we get along so why can't they?
If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants, then why is there so much pain?

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone

When every step I take is always too small
Maybe it's just something I can't admit but lately
I feel like I don't give a shit

Motivation such an aggravation
Accusations don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration never hard to break it
Situation never what you want it to be

What's the point of never making mistakes
Self-indulgence is such a hard habit to break
It's all just a waste of time in the end
I don't care, so why should I even pretend

Motivation such an aggravation
Accusations don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration never hard to break it
Situation never what you wanted

Nothing's new, everything's the same
It keeps on dragging me down, it's getting kind of lame
I'm falling further behind, there's nothing to explain
No matter what you say nothing's gonna change my mind

Can't depend on doubt until the end
It seems like leaving friends has become this years trend
And though I can't pretend, afraid to be this way
It's not the same but who's to blame
For all those stupid things I never said

And I'm still waiting for a good day
I think I've held this long enough
I think it's safe to tell you some things
It's not just what you say to people
And it's not the way you look at me
It's the way you present yourself
For all your worst critics to see


Then you were gone
All this time you just didn't know it yet


Another tragic case of feeling
Bruised and broken
Another tragic case and I've been
Still waiting for a good day"

Can you tell
That I'm losing myself
I think I'm trying too hard to
Let it show
To let you know
Don't trace your footsteps back to me

Cause I've been gone for a long time
Waiting on the sidelines
Hoping for a chance to play
Well I thought I would never leave anything behind
I also never thought I'd say


Can you tell
That I don't know myself
I need someone to remind me
To let it go
Please let me know
Don't trace your footsteps back to me



And if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't expect anything less


Forget my name"

That the way I feel is all I have
It could take a lifetime
To realize that you're alright
But she said

I'd know when you would come back
It's been a summer

It's burning up in here
Even though the bed is cold on your side
I'd rather die
Than spend this night here without you

I would try to fix these flaws of mine
If I could just see you for one more time
And I'm trying to convince myself
That the way I feel is all I have
I don't believe in sure things
There's pain in what the truth brings



I'd be the first one to know
If its smart for me to just let it go
I'll be the laughing stock of all time
Person most likely to find
Deciding if it's fate that made you avoid me to this day

That we still talk
It's just for show, isn't it?
It's my fault that it fell apart

Just maybe
You need this
And I didn't mean to
Lead you on

You were everything I wanted
But I just can't finish what I've started
There's no room left here on my back for you
It was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true
I'd still pick my friends over you
My friends over you

Please tell me everything
That you think that I should know
About all the plans you made
When I was nowhere to be found
And it's alright to forget
That we still talk
Its just for fun, isn't it?
It's my fault that it fell apart

Sort this out on your own time
Go on and sort this out on your own time

Before you jump to conclusions
About all the friends I have
Just remember they were born that way
Word travels fast when her name's involved

No matter how stupid I get you'll always want more"

I heard about the bad news today
A crowd of people around you
Telling you it's okay
And everything happens for a reason

When you lose a part of yourself
To somebody you know
It takes a lot to let go
Every breath that you remember
Pictures fade away but memory is forever

An empty chair at all the tables
And I'll be seeing you when all my days boil down
But it's better where you're going anyway

I'm sorry
I heard about the bad news today
It's really hard to get through
Tough times and long days
But it really just depends on the season



For now we'll say goodbye
We know it's not the last time
I've lost the best part of my day
But it's better where you're going anyway

Or what you were wearing
It's unclear about how we met
All I know it was the best conversation that I've ever had
To this day I never found someone
With eyes as wide as yours
I've been searching up and down this coast
Overlooking what I need the most

Did you notice I was afraid?
I thought I'd run out of things to say
Two more hours until today burns this away
And it starts all over again
The sky will never look the same again
Till you show me how it could be
The sky will never look the same again
Till you show me how it could be

And everything else is irrelevant
To the story so far
A coincidence that you look like her from a far
Is it true that you like to sleep alone?
Or is it what you just tell everyone?


And when the world turns over
Ill keep my ears to the wall
And when the world turns over
Ill keep my feet straight on the ground"

Someones in your house
The button the button the button the button the button the button the button the button the button
I'm sick of smiling
Hey this one was supposed to be on the hidden track on our last record
But Jordan got mad high and left the studio before we could do it
Shut up dude what you talking about?
Make way for the queen
Someone get my car out

Everyone has toothpick on their table

Everyone has toothpick on their table
We like the dental floss and
I forgot the words hold on"

Don't want to grow

The lights were off
When I got home
Black room, blue phone
Hey, I know your name
Weren't we almost friends?
Guess that depends
Take some benefit
With all your doubt
If this is principle
I'm dropping out

You demonize
You don't look so bad
You wouldn't take
What you couldn't have
My back is warm
With your friendly fire
I know you're trying
Could you please aim it higher?
Could you please aim it higher?

So alone, I wrote
I wrote this will
I will decline
This fish ain't big
This pond is small
So small of mind

Down at the liquor store
Beneath the neon sky
Our moonlight
Six A.M., the floor comes alive with lice
The pan's dried up so tight
With hardened beans
We're hungry
So I lean on you sometimes
Just to see you're still there
Your feet can't take the weight of one
Much less two
We hit concrete
How were we born into this mess?
I know I painted you a prettier picture, baby
We were run out on a rail
Fell from the wagon to the night train
I kissed the bottle
I should've been kissing you
You wake up to an empty night
With tears for two
Cigarettes, they fill the gaps
In our empty days
In our broken teeth
We're jonesing
Say mister, can you spare a dime?
Some change could make a change
Could buy some time
Some freedom
Or an ear to hear my story
It's all I've got
My fiction beats the hell out of my truth
A palm upturned burnt blue
Don't call it sunburn
You've been shaking on the job
Just one drink ahead of your past
There's a white light coming up
You draw the blinds, hoping it'll pass
I kissed the bottle
I should've been kissing you
You wake up to an empty night
With tears for two
I kissed the bottle
I should've been kissing you
You wake up to an empty night

I drove myself insane
No small getaway
Asleep with both hands on the wheel
White knuckle weekend
Chewing ephedrine
Going to an unnamed end
(Unending)

We met in rain
You asked me in
Seemed like a good sign
Now I need a guillotine
To get you off my mind
I brush my teeth until they break
Until I start bleeding
So when I smile, I'll know
I'm almost good enough for you
(And would you...)

Follow me to the end of the dare
Raise your eyes, return the stare
Become your words
Your words, so becoming
On any Sunday, I'll be there

I tried to drink you off my mind
I just got wasted
It only made the pain that much more acute
(But cute)
Isn't strong enough a word
Unintentionally gorgeous
An accidental charm
A graceful drinking arm

Follow me to the end of the dare
Raise your eyes, return the stare
Become your words

Soapy hands fumbling on porcelain
Hot, good coffee and a good, good book
Bicycle, bicycle

Breathing easier now
Tear the roof off your day
No one's coming over
It ain't written
So don't try to read it

Smell the hot rain on the street
Could be love, could be alcohol
Cup my hands around your face
A little frame, a lot of pain
I can tell the tears from the rain
One tastes sweet, the other plain

Breathing easier now
Tear the roof off your day
No one's coming over
It ain't written
So don't try to read it

And who am I to think I could hang
Such a precious life on a clever line?
You're in all the books I read
A hundred pages out of reach
And so I pull myself
Crawl to feet, hit the street
It'll take some time
To learn the lesson of the fall
And begin another climb

Tear the roof off your day
No one's coming over
It ain't written
So don't try to read it"

You'll sleep alone
Getting everything you wanted
Getting everything you wanted and some
Here's the kitchen, cook alone
Look at the water boil
At the table, sit and stare
Soup with bread with so much to care for...

All my friends back east keep asking
""What have you done with your life?""
Just a little too strung out to lie

Suddenly, it seems so clear
Rejecting what you can't have
Light a candle, smoke and pray
All good sins will find you, one day
Now another month is gone
Soon, it will be a year
Go to bed and say out loud
""Is it over where it's all gone wrong?""

All my friends back east keep asking
""What have you done with your life?""
Just a little too strung out to lie

My ambition keeps getting in the way
When I found my voice, there's nothing left to say
Inhibition keeps me behind this door
My life's a running joke
What am I?
What am I running for?"

Memory collecting before his time

I see a tear welling up in his eye
No, you can't cheat time
Don't let that control your life
Hold your breath, close your eyes
Just jump in, the water's fine
These pleas, fall on deaf ears
Ears that were once tuned to truth
A dated, washed up, old man
Has seen it all, nothing else for him to do
No, you can't cheat time
Don't let that control your life
Goes over your head, look over your shoulder
When you look back you're that much older
(It slips away)
Be what you're becoming
(It slips away)
And not who you were
(It slips away)
Grab hold of the here and now while you still have the chance
So are you giving up now?
As for adventures you've had your fill
Who says you're over the hill?
I think it was you, and you know very well
No, you can't cheat time

When will you trust yourself?

Away into the night
Storm rolling in
The darkness descending and then
She picks up her poison bottle
Cloudy sky, cloudy mind, now she feels at home
She drinks away her pain
As she takes your life into her hands
Out on the road
The poison has begun to settle in
She's going home
But wishes she could disappear again
She starts to swerve
The white line means nothing to her
She picks up her poison bottle
Heavy head, heavy eyes, will she make it home?
She drinks away her pain
As she takes your life into her hands
Her memories remain
As she takes your life into her hands
Losing control
Bits and pieces scatter like small toys
She'll never know
The lives she has taken and destroyed
She looks around
At flames eating bodies on the ground
She sees her broken poison bottle
Pick it up, smash it down in a pool of blood
The cops came and they took her away in chains"

Who is a foe, who's a friend, and who pretends
For his or her own benefit and all the while I know

If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they fall, they would fall (fall)

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complaining
Always complaining
If money is such a problem
Well they got mansions, think we should rob them

Well did you know when you were famous you could kill your wife
And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash, to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were smoking crack
McDonald's wouldn't even want to take you back
You could always just run for mayor of D.C

I'd like to see them spend a week, living life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they fall, they would fall

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complaining
Always complaining
If money is such a problem
Well they got mansions, think we should rob them (rob them, rob them)


They would fall (fall)
Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complaining
Always complaining
If money is such a problem
You got so many problems, I think I can solve them

Lifestyles of the rich and famous
We'll take your clothes, cash, cars, and homes, just stop complaining
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Lifestyles of the rich and famous"

I'm writing to you
Not to tell you that I still hate you
Just to ask you how you feel
And how we fell apart
How this fell apart

Are you happy out there in this great wide world?
Do you think about your sons?
Do you miss your little girl?
When you lay your head down
How do you sleep at night?
Do you even wonder if we're alright?
If we're alright
We're alright
We're alright

It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
You broke my mother's heart
You broke your children for life
It's not okay, but we're alright
I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
But those are just a long lost memory of mine
I spent so many years learning how to survive
And I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive

The days I spent so cold, so hungry
Were full of hate, I was so angry
The scars run deep inside this tattooed body
There's things I'll take to my grave
But I'm okay
I'm okay

It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
You broke my mother's heart
You broke your children for life
It's not okay, but we're alright
I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
But those are just a long lost memory of mine
I spent so many years learning how to survive
And I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive

Sometimes I forgive
Yeah, and this time, I'll admit
That I miss you, said I miss you

It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
You broke my mother's heart

Good Charlotte,Movin' On,The Young and the Hopeless,10/01/2002,"When I think about my life I wonder
If I will survive to live to see 25 or will I just fall
Like all my friends they just keep dying
People 'round me always crying in this place that I like to call my home

But not everybody knows that everybody goes to a better place
And not everybody knows that everybody could be living their last days

But the hard time will come and will keep moving on we're moving on
Keep moving on!
Life! Hope! Truth! Trust!
Faith! Pride! Love! Lust!
On without the things we've lost; the things we've gained, we'll take with us

And alls I've got are these two hands to make myself a better man
I wonder if I will ever see the end of this
With all this rain it just keeps falling
On my head and now I'm calling
Out to someone else to help me make it through

But not everybody knows that everybody goes to a better place
And not everybody knows that everybody could be living their last days

But the hard times will come and will keep moving on, we're moving on
Keep moving on!
Life! Hope! Truth! Trust!
Faith! Pride! Love! Lust!
Pain! Hate! Lies! Guilt!
Laugh! Cry! Live! Die!
Some friends become enemies, some friends become your family
Make the best with what you're given; this ain't dying, this is living

So you're moving on and you've got nothing to prove to anyone
But you'll get through, we're moving on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on and on an and on and on

Keep moving on!
Life! Hope! Truth! Trust!
Faith! Pride! Love! Lust!
Pain! Hate! Lies! Guilt!
Laugh! Cry! Live! Die!
Some friends become enemies, some friends become your family
Make the best with what you're given; this ain't dying, this is living"

His throat
And called you on the telephone
To take off
My disguise

You mourn the death of your bloody valentine

You mourn the death of your bloody valentine

Police and
Flashing lights
The rain came down so hard that night and the
Headlines read
A lover died
No tell-tale heart was left to find when you...

You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
The night he died
You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
One last time
Singing

He dropped you off, I followed him home
Then I, I stood outside his bedroom window
Standing over him, he begged me not to do
What I knew I had to do because I'm so in love with you

Oh, my love

I'll wash my bloody hands and
We'll start a new life

When will you laugh again

We'd make noise until 3 am
And the neighbors would complain

I woke up knowing
Today is the day I will die
Ca$hdogg was barking
Went to the park
And enjoyed it one last time
I called my mother
Told her I loved her
And I begged her not to cry
I wrote a letter
I said I'd miss her
And I signed that good bye

You know the happiest day of my life
I swear the happiest day of my life
Is the day that I die

Can you feel the cold tonight? (the day that I died)
It sets in, but it's alright (the day that I died)
Darkness falls, I'm letting go (the day that I died)
All alone, but I feel fine (the day that I died)

We took a drive and
We drove through DC
To see the places we lived
Long conversations
We talked of old friends
And all the things that we did
The summer nights
Drunken fights
Mistakes we made
Did we live it right?

You know the happiest day of my life
I swear the happiest day of my life
Is the day that I die

Can you feel the cold tonight? (the day that I died)
It sets in, but it's alright (the day that I died)

Doing himself in

This is the story of my old man
Just like his father before him
I'm telling you
Do anything you can
So you don't end up just like them
Like them

Monday he woke up and hated life
Drank until Wednesday and left his wife
Thursday through Saturday lost everything
Woke up on Sunday miserable again

I remember baseball games
And working on the car
He told that he loved me
And that I would go far
Showed me how to work hard and
Stick up for myself
I wish he wasn't too hard
To listen to himself

This is the story of my old man
Just like his father before him
I'm telling you
Do anything you can
So you don't end up just like them

Forget what we know, it's just a big show
What they want to control
So jaded, frustrated, it's all so complicated
Fashion no passion surrounds me

All I know is I've heard this all before, reality's a bore
You ask me to believe in something fake
Well I, can't bring myself to do what you want me to
This is who we are and nothing's going to change
Nothing's going to change

I can't take part in the businessman illusion
I'll take my chance in the real world confusion
Don't blame us, who do we trust
When they're so dishonest
No patience, this nation's obsessed with exploitation
Lying denying surrounds me

All I know is I've heard this all before, reality's a bore
You ask me to believe in something fake
Well I, can't bring myself to do what you want me to
This is who we are and nothing's going to change

Don't think you can ignore us
Don't tell me that we're to blame
Don't pick our future for us
Or act like we're the same

All I know is I've heard this all before, reality's a bore
You ask me to believe in something fake
Well I, can't bring myself to do what you want me to
This is who we are and nothing's going to change

Thanks for nothing
(I've heard this all before)
Thanks for nothing
(reality's a bore)
Thanks for nothing
(i'll never be the same)
Thanks for nothing
(and nothing's gonna change)"
NOFX,13 Stitches,The War on Errorism,01/01/2003,"The first time I saw The Descendents
They were the fastest band I'd ever seen
No one in the crowd really cared for them
We were waiting for The Alley Cats to play
After a couple months I heard Kabuki Girl
On Rodney on the ROQ late Sunday night
That was enough for me, I hopped the bus
To Licorice Pizza and bought my all time favorite record
The next time I went to The Whisky
It was D.O.A. with Millions of Dead Cops
The latter band played faster than I could believe
But the songs sounded the same and kinda sucked
Said John Wayne was a Nazi
And Joey Shithead was a drunk
Then John Macias beat some hippie to a pulp
Cause having long hair was a mistake
The third time I went to the hospital
I needed 13 stitches in my head
I managed to catch about 6 songs of Ill Repute
Then some suicidal threw me into a post
My girlfriend started to cry cause we had to leave
Before DRI played 50 lousy songs
My blood stained shirt smelled of clove cigarettes
But it sure looked pretty cool after a wash"
AFI,Girl's Not Grey,Sing the Sorrow,01/12/2003,"I'll lay me down tonight
Much further down
Swim in the calm tonight
This art does drown

(What follows) me as the whitest lace of light
(Will swallow whole) just begs to be imbrued
(What follows) has led me to this place
Where I belong, with all erased
What follows

All insects sing tonight
The coldest sound
I'd send God's grace tonight
Could it be found?

(What follows) me as the whitest lace of light
(Will swallow whole) just begs to be imbrued
(What follows) has led me to this place
Where I belong, with all erased

I'll lay me down tonight
Much further down
Watch stars go out tonight
On sinking ground
I'll lay me down, I'll lay me down

Where I belong, with all erased

Sum 41,The Hell Song,Does This Look Infected?,02/01/2003,"Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same things to you
It's just a matter how you solve them
And knowing how to change the things you've been through
I feel I've come to realize
How fast life can be compromised
Step back to see what's going on
I can't believe this happened to you
(This happened to you)

It's just a problem that I'm faced with; am I
Not the only one who hates to stand by?
Complications that are first in this line
With all these pictures running through my mind
Knowing endless consequences
I feel so useless in this
Get back, step back, and as for me
I can't believe

Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure anymore

Everybody's got their problems

Never end up being what we chose

Good Charlotte,The Anthem,The Young and the Hopeless,02/28/2003,"Yeah
Here we go

It's a new day but it all feels old
""It's a good life"" ' that's what I'm told
But every day, it all just feels the same
At my high school it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there ' it only made me see
That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna to hear the words you say and...

I don't ever wanna' I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

""Go to college or university
Get a real job"" ' that's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm going to get by and just do my time
Outta step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat so pay no mind
Do you really wanna be like them?
Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd? 'Cause...

I don't ever wanna' I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

Shake it once, that's fine
Shake it twice, that's okay
Shake it three times
You're playing with your self again
(You, don't wanna be just like you)
What I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Now you can feel me, sing if you're with me
You, don't wanna be just like you

This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Now you can feel me, sing if you're with me

The Ataris,All You Can Ever Learn Is What You Already Know,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"Is this how it was intended?
The sunrise over smokestacks in the Midwest
The beauty of this abandoned factory
Christmas lights blinking on and off all
Out of time in what used to be
Your pink house dreams of a middle class America
I'm trying to believe in you, but all these satellites
And shattered dreams are blocking out my view
Please don't forget who you really are
'Cause nothing really matters when we're gone
Fell in love with his keno waitress
They honeymooned in Memphis
They were married by the drive-up window
Trailer parks, neon signs, and an empty box of Lucky Strikes
All used up on the dashboard of America
I'm trying to believe in you but
This world sold its faith for parking lots and drunk sincerity
Please don't forget who you really are
'Cause nothing really matters when we're
You'll be saddened to know, the train tracks
You once walked as a young boy
Are now nothing but a graveyard
Please don't forget how small we really are
Nothing really matters when we're gone
Nothing really matters
I'm trying to believe in you"
The Ataris,Eight of Nine,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"These hospital walls are the palest of white
Here in this desert they're reciting my last rights
The smell of these halls brings temporary comfort
As oxygen flows through my blood
El Corazon was poisoned tonight
She's on her eight of nine
When half of all your prayers are insincere
The other half are lies
Here is this watermark under this bridge
The point where it crested
Rolled back and drifted into the sea
I climb from this wreckage
As the smoke begins to clear from my lungs
The closest of close calls has happened tonight
It's time that I made things right
For the first time since the last time
Let this moment of clarity
Lift this curse that has been cast upon me
So appreciate the good times
But don't take the worst for granted
Because you only get so many second chances"
The Ataris,In This Diary,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"Here in this diary
I write you visions of my summer
It was the best I ever had
There were choruses and sing-alongs
And that unspoken feeling
Of knowing that right now is all that matters
All the nights we stayed up talking
Listening to '80s songs
And quoting lines from all those movies that we love
It still brings a smile to my face
I guess when it comes down to it
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right
Breaking into hotel swimming pools
And wreaking havoc on our world
Hanging out at truck stops just to pass the time
The blacktop singing me to sleep
Lighting fireworks in parking lots
Illuminate the blackest nights
Cherry cokes under this moonlit summer sky
2015 Riverside, it's time to say goodbye
Get on the bus, it's time to go
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right
(Get it right)
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right"
The Ataris,Looking Back on Today,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"30th of April
Seems like yesterday
Bought a house above the ocean
Where our kids could laugh and play
I called you from Paris
To tell you that I
Wrote our names on the observation deck
Of the Eiffel Tower
Remember those nights
Playing ""Summer Wind"" on the jukebox of the bar we used to go
We made out in the bathroom and you walked me to my house
I tried to convince you not to go home
If only I had more time
I'd take you where you wanted to go
Italy isn't the same without you here
If only I had one wish
I'd want a million trillion life times that I could spend with you
I'd fall in love with you again and again
First of November
1998
I was thinking of what to say
When I would call
Denise come over to my house
Cause you're the one for me
We'll drink cheap wine
And watch for shooting stars
Remember our first apartment?
Our couch was never big enough for two
Still we'd fall asleep in each other's arms
And wake up on the floor
Now, looking back, it was made for me and you
If only I had more time
I'd take you where you wanted to go
Japan is really nice this time of year
If only I had one wish
I'd want a million trillion lifetimes that I could spend with you
I'd fall in love with you again and again"
The Ataris,My Reply,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"I got your letter
And the poetry you sent me
Postmarked in December of last year
I really hope you're doing better
All your friends close by your side
One step closer to recovery
I wish there was something I could say
To erase each and every page you've been through
Even though it's not my place to save you
I appreciate but can't accept this thank you note
That's sealed with your last breath
And I won't stand aside and listen to you give up
If you'll just hold on for one more second
If you just hold on to what you have
Just hold on, just hold on
You will wake up tomorrow
If you'll just hold on for one more second
If you just hold on to what you have
Just hold on, just hold on
You will wake up tomorrow
These arms remain stretched out to you
Maybe someday you'll accept them
Maybe it's too late to save
A young girl's heart that's long stopped beating
Wake up, wake up, you've gotta believe
Wake up, wake up, you can't give up
Time keeps going on without us
Long after we're dead and gone
I wish there was something I could say
To erase each and every page you've been through
Even though it's not my place to save you
I appreciate but can't accept this thank you note
That's sealed with your last breath
And I won't stand aside and listen to you give up
If you'll just hold on for one more second
Just hold on to what you have
If you just hold on, just hold on
If you'll just hold on for one more second
Just hold on to what you have
If you just hold on, just hold on"
The Ataris,Radio #2,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"Meet me at midnight, the broadcast tower
High above the hollywood sign
You bring your guitar and I'll bring my radio, radio
Everyone look up for miles around
To witness this beautiful sight
We'll set bonfires, pretend it's the Fourth of July
This is the starting of a brand new revolution
Bite the hand that feeds
Stand up and fight against the messages that they're sending
Stop their frequency
You're always talking, it's neverending
It's about time that we turned off the radio
Call the request lines and tell them that it's over
You're always playing all of the same songs
Over and over again
It's about time that we all turned off the radio
We'll listen to b-sides and sing along
To anthems of the years gone by
Integrity and honesty will prevail tonight
When it's all over, one question still remains
Why do so many bands never make it to the radio?
This is the starting of a brand new revolution
Bite the hand that feeds
Stand up and fight against the messages that they're sending
Stop their frequency
You're always talking, it's neverending
It's about time that we turned off the radio
Call the request lines and tell them that it's over
You're always playing all of the same songs
Over and over again
It's about time that we all turned off the radio
Look outside your FM dial they're preaching lies in 4/4 time
Our generation without a voice is stripped of pride
You're always talking, it's neverending
It's about time that we turned off the radio
Call the request lines and tell them that it's over
You're always playing all of the same songs
Over and over again
It's about time that we all turned off the radio
You're always talking
It's about time that we all turned off the radio
You're always playing all of the same songs
It's about time that we all turned off the radio"
The Ataris,"So Long, Astoria","So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"It was the first snow of the season
I can almost see you breathing
In the middle of that empty street
Sometimes I still see myself
In that lonesome bedroom
Playing my guitar and singing
Songs of hope for a better future
Life is only as good as the memories we make
And I'm taking back what belongs to me
Polaroids of classrooms unattended
These relics of remembrance are just like shipwrecks
Only they're gone faster than the smell after it rains
Last night while everyone was sleeping
I drove through my old neighborhood
And resurrected memories from ashes
We said that we would never fit in
When we were really just like them
Does rebellion ever make a difference?
Life is only as good as the memories we make
And I'm taking back what belongs to me
Polaroids of classrooms unattended
These relics of remembrance are just like shipwrecks
Only they're gone faster than the smell after it rains
So long, Astoria
I found a map to buried treasure
And even if we come home empty handed
We'll still have our stories of battle scars
Pirate ships and wounded hearts
Broken bones and all the best of friendships
And when this hourglass has filtered out
Its final grain of sand
I raise my glass to the memories we had
This is my wish and I'm taking it back
I'm taking them all back"
The Ataris,Summer '79,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"Our last day of summer
1979
We gotta live up one time before it's over
We will make history tonight
Out at the drive-in
All of our closest friends will be sneaking in
You'll be spending your whole night
Trying everything you can to get that girl to notice you
We Are the Champions
Playing loud on the radio station
Everyone sing along
With these anthems of our generation
Cruising down Pacific Coast Highway
Put the top down, crawl into the back seat
Let's create anthems of our own tonight
Down at the roller rink
All the cool kids crowding around the air hockey table
Hey, my best friend likes you
I hear you shout at me as you go skating by
We Are the Champions
Playing loud on the radio station
Everyone sing along with these anthems of our generation
Cruisin down Pacific Coast Highway
Put the top down, crawl into the back seat
Let's create anthems of our own tonight
Sneak out of the window, darling
Let's live like outlaws, honey
We'll never look back
Climb out on this rooftop
And stare at the city lights below us
This world belongs to us tonight
The kids will keep raging on and they ain't ever gonna stop
We Are the Champions
Playing loud on the radio station
Everyone sing along with these anthems of our generation
Cruisin down Pacific Coast Highway
Put the top down, crawl into the back seat
Let's create anthems of our own tonight"

We'll drive out past the runway
And watch the planes go flying by
The runway lights are the deepest blue
Like the colors of your eyes
So close them tight and kiss me one last time

If you could go anywhere right now, where would you go
And would you miss me when you get there
There's no place that I would rather be

Please don't let me, go falling from the sky
This fasten seatbelt sign just needs to go out
If only you could be, right here by my side
Home wouldn't seem so far from here

Passport, customs, carry-on, remember
To shut off all of your, electronic devices
Fell asleep on Tuesday, woke up Monday afternoon
I slept right through your international dateline

If you could go anywhere right now
Where would you go
And would you miss me when you get there
There's no place that I would rather be

Please don't let me, go falling from the sky
This fasten seat belt sign just needs to go out

Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not at home

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
I don't understand what happened to our love
But baby when I get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today
I saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
""Don't look back. You can never look back.""
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone"

Apartment 108
I'll always keep you in my heart
Anderson is cold tonight
The leaves are scattered on the ground
I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile
Sometimes this song feels like a dream
I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds
I remember how our family split apart
I don't think I ever told you
But I know you always did your best
In the hard times that only made us stronger
As I sit here all alone
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone
I'll never be the same without you
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know
Sometimes we're helpless and alone
But you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on
Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
And say this prayer for you tonight
Because nothing is impossible
As I sit here all alone
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone
I'll never be the same without you
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know
Sometimes we're helpless and alone
But you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on
The hardest part isn't finding what we need to be
It's being content with who we are
Stay who you are
Stay who you are
Stay who you are
Stay who you are
Stay who you are"

I can hear the church bells calling out my name
This table is set for one
Even angels would be homesick in this forsaken town
On random notes of parchment
I'm scrawling my existence
Dressed in white
This candle radiates throughout the night
And it's never burning out
Never burning out
From this second story window
I can hear the children down on Main Street
They're singing their songs tonight
In the shadows, I will listen to their every movement
Mr. Higginson, am I not good enough for the world?
Am I destined only to die the same way that I lived
In seclusion?
From high up on this mountain
I can almost see your lonely windowsill
They'll carry you off tonight
There's a ghost in your old bedroom
And a candle burning bright
If I died tomorrow
Would this song live on forever?"

I crumble, I cannot, I cannot find reflection in these days

(Listen close) Beat by beat
(You can hear when the heart stops) I saved the pieces
(When it broke) And ground them all to dust

I am destroyed by the inside, I disassociate
I hope to destroy the outside, it will alleviate and elevate me

Like water flowing into lungs, I'm flowing through these days
Like morphine cuts through, through dead end veins, I'm numbing in these days
So...

AFI,...But Home is Nowhere,Sing the Sorrow,03/11/2003,"Twenty-six years and seems like I've just begun
To understand my, my intimate is no one
When the director sold the show, who bought its last rites?
They cut the cast, the music, and the lights

This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time, left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone

Twenty-six years end, still speaking in these tongues
Such revelations, while understood by no one
When the new actor stole the show, who questioned his grace?
Please clear this house of ill-acquired taste

This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time and left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone

Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something real

I lay strewn across the floor, can't solve this puzzle
Everyday, another small piece can't be found
I lay strewn across the floor, pieced up in sorrow
The pieces are lost, these pieces don't fit
Pieced together incomplete and empty

This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural

Let me hide within your black, the still inside your eyes
Deafened, caught within a cry
So sensual, as step by step by step, I separate
As breath to breath, I suffocate

(Oh, we dance in misery)
All lost in the arms of our misery, oh
(Oh, we dance in misery)
And we dance on, and we dance on
Swept off our feet by misery, we're swept into the shadows

So who will follow?
Who is the lead?
I know I'll leave a stain, because I bleed
As we dance, we all dance
We all have no chance in this horrid romance

To leave this dead space with hatred, so alive

Writhing with sickness, thrown into banality, I decay
Killed by the weakness, but forced to return, turn it off

I watch the stars as they fall from the sky
I held a fallen star and it wept for me, dying
I feel the fallen stars encircle me, now as they cry

Out there, so quickly, grows malignant tribes
Post-human extinction excels, unrecognized

Feeling surrounded, so bored with mortality, I decay
All of this hatred is fucking real, turn it on, yeah

I watch the stars as they fall from the sky
I held a fallen star and it wept for me, dying
I feel the fallen stars encircle me, now as they cry

It won't be all right, despite what they say
Just watch the stars tonight as they, as they disappear, disintegrate
And I disintegrate 'cause this hate is fucking real
And I hope to shade the world as stars go out and I disintegrate"

You're going out, going out, forever unknown
These waves of plastic fame go out of fashion

You're going out, going out
(Because you're dying to become forever unknown, unknown)

From above, a rain of ashes descends
Like anathema, I will remain, forever will remain
From below, in my seclusion
Look up to the sky to see paper wings and watch them burn

Without habitation, you'll never find a soul inside
No life, but nothing's died
No lights, but quite the show
Just as long as no one ever knows
All motion is pantomime

You're going out, going out, forever unknown

Dancing in the rain of descending ash
Dancing on your grave, I'll see you all falling
Dancing in the rain of descending ash
Dancing in your dust, I'll see you all falling

I'd stop it, had you a heart (your heart)
I'd stop it, had you a heart (your heart)

Chrysanthemums of white, they seemed so beautiful
I can remember, I searched for the amaranth
I'd shut my eyes to see

Oh, how I smiled then, so near the cherished ones
I knew they would appear, saw not a single one
Oh, how I smiled then, waiting so patiently
I'd make a wish and bleed

While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away

I can remember, dreamt them so vividly
Soft creatures draped in white, light kisses gracing me
I can remember when I first realized
Dreams were the only place to see them

While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away
Hope was wasting away
Faith was wasting away
I was wasting away

I never, never wanted this
I always wanted to believe
I never, never wanted this
How could I have become?
I never, never wanted this
But from the start, I'd been deceived
I never, never wanted this
How could I have become?
I never, never wanted this
I always wanted to believe
I never, never wanted this
I never, never wanted this
But from the start, I'd been deceived
I never, never wanted this

Inside a crumbling effigy
But you promised
So dies all innocence
But you promised me

While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away
Hope was wasting away
Faith was wasting away

""Poisoned hearts will never change,"" walked away again

Felt the chill upon my face, cooling from within

Hard to notice gleaming from the sky
When you're staring at the cracks
Hard to notice what is passing by with eyes lowered
You walked away, heard them say
""Poisoned hearts will never change,"" walked away again

All the cracks, they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me
All the cracks, they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me, and I fell apart

Or were you sent to save me?
I've thought too much, you won't find anything
Worthy of redeeming

Yo he estado aqu' muchas veces antes y regres'

To break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away

Imperfect cry, and scream in ecstasy
So what befalls the flawless?
Look what I've built (please don't do this)
It shines so beautifully (why won't you look at me)
Now watch as it destroys me

Y regreso aqu' otra vez y comienzo

To break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away
Break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away

I left it all behind, and never said goodbye
I left it all behind, and never said goodbye
I left it all behind, and never said goodbye
I left it all to die
I saw its birth, I watched it grow
I felt it change me
I took the life, I ate it slow
Now it consumes me

Break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away
Break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away
Heart away"
AFI,The Spoken Word,Sing the Sorrow,03/11/2003,"We held hands on the last night of earth. Our mouths filled with dust, we kissed in the fields and under trees, screaming like dogs, bleeding dark into the leaves. It was empty on the edge of town but we knew everyone floated along the bottom of the river. So we walked through the waste where the road curved into the sea and the shattered seasons lay, and the bitter smell of burning was on you like a disease. In our cancer of passion you said, ""Death is a midnight runner.""
The sky had come crashing down like the news of an intimate suicide. We picked up the shards and formed them into shapes of stars that wore like an antique wedding dress. The echoes of the past broke the hearts of the unborn as the Ferris wheel silently slowed to a stop. The few insects skittered away in hopes of a better pastime. I kissed you at the apex of the maelstrom and asked if you would accompany me in a quick fall, but you made me realize that my ticket wasn't good for two. I rode alone
You said, ""The cinders are falling like snow."" There is poetry in despair, and we sang with unrivaled beauty, bitter elegies of savagery and eloquence. Of blue and grey. Strange, we ran down desperate streets and carved our names in the flesh of the city. The sun has stagnated somewhere beyond the rim of the horizon and the darkness is a mystery of curves and lines. Still, we lay under the emptiness and drifted slowly outward, and somewhere in the middle in the wilderness we found salvation scratched into the earth like a message"
AFI,This Celluloid Dream,Sing the Sorrow,03/11/2003,"Calling tears from deep inside, oh, you're so exquisite
And in the mirror, all midnight eyes
Oh, if I could remain, but it's just a visit
All midnight eyes, read ""vacancy""
Twisted, twisting

To the lovely dancing lights, I begged, ""May I cut in?""
But they never stopped playing their song
Of a joyous song they sing, I've heard whispers
On a freezing note, I resonate

Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Just like a memory, it twists me
Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Twist, twisting me

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
On to the melting boy, and melt away
You light as gently, you're so cinematic
Bathed in your radiance, I melt

In the glitter, in the dark, sunk into velvet
Praying this will never end
In the shadow of a star, in static pallor
I realized I never began

Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Just like a memory, it twists me
Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Twist, twisting me

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
On to the melting boy, and melt away
You light as gently, you're so cinematic
Bathed in your radiance, I melt

All the colors, upon leaving, all will turn to grey
All the colors, upon leaving, all will turn to grey
(All grey) all the colors (all grey) upon leaving
(All grey) all will turn to grey
(All grey) all the colors (all grey) upon leaving
(All grey) all will turn to grey, grey
Twisting me

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
On to the melting boy, and melt away
You light as gently, you're so cinematic
Bathed in your radiance

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
You land as lightly as the new snow, and melt away
You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
Bathed in your radiance, I melt"

Forever haunted, more than afraid
Asphyxiate on words I would say
I'm drawn to a blackened sky as I turn blue

There are no flowers, no, not this time
There'll be no angels gracing the lines
Just these stark words, I find
I'd show a smile, but I'm too weak
I'd share with you, could I only speak
Just how much this hurts me

I cannot stay here, I cannot leave
Just like all I loved, I'm make believe
Imagine heart, I disappear
Seems no one will appear here and make me real

There are no flowers, no, not this time
There'll be no angels gracing the lines
Just these stark words, I find
I'd show a smile, but I'm too weak
I'd share with you, could I only speak
Just how much this hurts me

I'd tell you how it haunts me
I'd tell you how it haunts me

I'd tell you how it haunts me
(Cuts through my days, and sinks into my dreams)
You don't care that it haunts me

There are no flowers, no, not this time

NOFX,Re-Gaining Unconsciousness,The War on Errorism,03/25/2003,"First they put away the dealers
Keep our kids safe and off the streets
Then they put away the prostitutes
Keep married men cloistered at home
Then they shooed away the bums
Then they beat and bashed the queers
Turned away asylum-seekers
Fed us suspicions and fears
We didn't raise our voice
We didn't make a fuss
It's funny there was no one left to notice
When they came for us
Looks like witches are in season
You better fly your flag and be aware
Of anyone who might fit the description
Diversity is now our biggest fear
Now with our conversations tapped
And our differences exposed
How ya supposed to love your neighbor
With our minds and curtains closed?
We used to worry 'bout big brother
Now we got a big father and an even bigot mother
And still you believe
This aristocracy gives a fuck about you
They put the mock in demockracy
And you swallowed every hook
The sad truth is you would rather
Follow the school into the net
Cause swimming alone at sea
Is not the kind of freedom you actually want
So go back to your crib and suck on a tit
Go bask in the warmth of your diaper
You're sitting in shit and piss
While sucking a giant pacifier
A country of adult infants
A legion of mental midgets
All regaining their unconsciousness"

It's simply pathetic if I call you anymore
I can't figure it now
We tallied our scores
I got knocked out
I know when you come to town
I know where you drop your dime and whom it's for
I'm not good enough to time your cup of coffee 15 years... was long enough
Look at me
I'm an old colleague
Another hard knocks day acquaintance
Finally you are free of me
It must be true or you'd give a minute
But it's always my fault
Always it's your forgiveness
This unbalanced resolve
I must be hateful
So I hang up the phone
Call it a small sacrifice
You still hear me now
Dear you, the vinyl it was blue
Stalking poor Blake commiserating drunks at sea
Do you remember when Jawbreaker rocked ""The boat""?
I'm sure you do...and don't
Look at me
I'm an old fly buddy
Just a blue coach class acquaintance
Finally you are free of me
It must be true 'cause it only makes sense
I can still see you now
Pictures are in every town
I can still write it down ""I must be hateful""
I can hang up the phone
Even at those lofty heights
You still hear me now"

Why think of all the bad things when life is so good?
Why help with an 'am' when there's always a 'could'?
Let the whales worry about the poisons in the sea
Outside of California, it's foreign policy
I don't want changes, I have no reactions
Your dilemmas are my distractions

That's no way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco, Franco Un-American

I never looked around, never second-guessed
Then I read some Howard Zinn now I'm always depressed
And now I can't sleep from years of apathy
All because I read a little Noam Chomsky
I'm eating vegetation, cause of Fast Food Nation
I'm wearing uncomfortable shoes cause of globalization
I'm watching Michael Moore expose the awful truth
I'm listening to Public Enemy and Reagan Youth
I see no world peace cause of zealous armed forces
I eat no breath-mints cause they're from de-hoofed horses

Now the idiots have taken over
Spreading like a social cancer, is there an answer?
Mensa membership conceding
Tell me why and how are all the stupid people breeding
Watson, it's really elementary
The industrial revolution
Has flipped the bitch on evolution
The benevolent and wise are being thwarted, ostracized, what a bummer
The world keeps getting dumber
Insensitivity is standard and faith is being fancied over reason
Darwin's rolling over in his coffin
The fittest are surviving much less often
Now everything seems to be reversing, and it's worsening
Someone flopped a steamer in the gene pool
Now angry mob mentality's no longer the exception, it's the rule
And I'm starting to feel a lot like Charlton Heston
Stranded on a primate planet
Apes and orangutans that ran it to the ground
With generals and the armies that obeyed them
Followers following fables
Philosophies that enable them to rule without regard
There's no point for democracy when ignorance is celebrated
Political scientists get the same one vote as some Arkansas inbred
Majority rule, don't work in mental institutions
Sometimes the smallest softest voice carries the grand biggest solutions
What are we left with?
A nation of god-fearing pregnant nationalists
Who feel it's their duty to populate the homeland
Pass on traditions
How to get ahead religions
And prosperity via simpleton culture

Now want their fries and coke
Cursing and birds are not allowed
In fact let's keep noise levels down

Why don't we put pads on the kids?
Helmets, head gear and mouth pieces!
Then we could pad the floors and walls
Put cameras inside bathroom stalls
We make sure only nice bands play
Make every show a matinee
Teach kids to be all they can be
And we could sing my country tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
When did punk rock become so safe?
I know it wasn't Duane or Fletcher
Who put up the barricades
Like a stake in the heart
Somehow we got driven apart
I want conflict! I want dissent!
I want the scene to represent
Our hatred of authority
Our fight against complacency
Stop singing songs 'bout girls and love!
You killed the owl! You freed the dove!
Confrontation and politics
Replaced with harmonies and shticks
When did punk rock become so tame?

Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside
When you left that night
It's about time that you got sick of me
No longer fun, and so far from interesting
I thought that I found me a cure for feeling old
Just one more line to keep me sleeping loudly and cold
In disgrace with a shameful regret
As I talk in tongues to myself in my bed
Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside
When you left that night

This bouncing baby boy's now turning baby blue
I've got your pictures on my walls
I've got a long list of calls I must make
To your existing family

Traded true love for insult and injury
We washed it down the drain
With one silver bullet and two Vicodin

Suitcase already packed
Note on the bedstand signed in blood
Sincerely, never coming back

A nightmarish household in which she died
Because it made her feel at home
Somehow made me feel at home
A poinsettia in poison rain

Traded true love for insult and injury

And I wait here, and sometimes I get one
It's nothing I'll forget when the moon gets tired
You are stuck to me everyday
Believe in what I am because it's all I have today
And tomorrow who knows where we'll be
From here I can hardly see a thing
But I will follow anyone who brings me to you
For now, forever, for on and on and on
You know it starts here, outside waiting in the cold
Kiss me once in the snow, I swear it never gets old
And I will promise you I can make it warmer next year
You know I came here when I needed your soft voice
I needed to hear something that sounded like an answer
Now I stay here, and every day I get one
It's nothing I'll forget when the moon gets tired
You are stuck to me everyday
Believe in what I am because it's all I have today
And tomorrow who knows where we'll be
From here I can hardly see a thing
But I will follow anyone who brings me to you
For now, forever, for on and on and on
So go plug in your electric blanket
We can stay in 'till our southern summer wedding day
Go plug in your electric blanket
We can stay here"
Alkaline Trio,This Could Be Love,Good Mourning,05/13/2003,"I've got a book of matches
I've got a can of kerosene
I've got some bad ideas
Involving you and me
I don't blame you for walking away
I touched myself at thoughts of flames
I shat the bed, I laid there in it
Thinking of you, wide awake for days
And I found you tongue-tied
In my twisted little brain
You couldn't crack a smile
I didn't catch your name
I don't blame you for walking away
I'd do the same if I saw me
I swear it's not contagious
In four short steps we can erase this
Step one, slit my throat
Step two, play in my blood
Step three, cover me in dirty sheets
And run laughing out of the house
Step four, stop off at Edgebrook Creek
And rinse your crimson hands
You took me hostage and made your demands
I couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers, one by one
I'm like a broken record
I've got a needle scratching me
It injects the poisons
Of alcohol IV
I don't blame you for walking away
I'd do the same if I saw me
I swear it's not contagious
Swear to God it's not contagious
Step one, slit my throat
Step two, play in my blood
Step three, cover me in dirty sheets
And run laughing out of the house
Step four, stop at Lake Michigan
And rinse your crimson hands
You took me hostage and made your demands
I couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers, one by one
This could be love
Love for fire
This could be love
Love for fire
This could be love
For fire, forever more
Step one, slit my throat
Step two, play in my blood
Step three, cover me in dirty sheets
And run laughing out of the house
Step four stop off at Berkeley Marina
And rinse your crimson hands
You took me hostage and made your demands
I couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers, one by one"
Alkaline Trio,We've Had Enough,Good Mourning,05/20/2003,"In the shadows where the heads hang low
You hear the voices as the wind blows
Asking can't you see?
Reminding you to breathe
It's only time before it catches up
To you and all your broken luck
I've found a better way
To get even with my memory
In the darkness where the angels cry
Give us water, give us back our lives
Our bed's this concrete floor
And it's all we have left to live for
A day we'll never face, we're only
Second-handed, sick, and lonely
Fighting back the tears
And every urge to Van Gogh both our ears
That's it, we've had enough
Please turn that fucking radio off
Ain't nothing on the air wave in the despair we feel
NO!
In the shadows where the heads hang low
You hear the voices as the wind blows
Asking can't you see?

To get even with my enemies
That's it, we've had enough
Please turn that fucking radio off
Ain't nothing on the air wave in the despair we feel
That said, We've had enough
Put ""Walk Among Us"" on and turn it up
Ain't nothing on the air wave in the hatred we feel
NO!
This is our biggest fear
The only tunes that we hear
Come via antenna to your car radio
Oh no, no, no
That's it, we've had enough
We've had enough
That's it, we've had enough
We've had enough"

Yellowcard,Back Home,Ocean Avenue,07/22/2003,"Don't know what I was looking for
When I went home, I found me alone
And sometimes, I need someone to say
""You'll be alright, what's on your mind?""
But the water's shallow here, and I am full of fear
And empty-handed after two long years

Another sunny day in California
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away
Before you get a chance to feel it

Back home, I always thought I wanted so much more
Now I'm not too sure
Cause sometimes I miss knowing someone's there for me
And feeling free
Free to stand beside the ocean in moonlight
And light myself a smoke beneath the dark Atlantic sky

Another sunny day in California
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away
Before you get a chance to feel it

Everybody here is living life in fear of falling out of line
Tearing lives apart and breaking lots of hearts just to pass the time
And the eyes get red in the back of your head, this place will make you blind
Put it all behind me and I'll be just fine

Another sunny day beneath this cloudless sky
Sometimes I wish that it would rain here
And wash away the west coast dreaming from my eyes
There's nothing real for them to see here

Another starry night in California
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away
Before you get a chance
Before you get a chance to feel it"

Think about the heroes saving life in the dark

But you still came back for me
You were strong and you believed

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Be strong, believe
Be strong, believe

Think about the chance I never had to say
Thank you for giving up your life that day
Never fearing, only hearing voices calling out
Let it all go, the life that you know, just to bring it down alive
And you still came back for me
You were strong and you believed

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright

Wanna tell the kids they'll never know how much I love to see them smile
Wanna make a change or two right now
Wanna live a life like you somehow
Wanna make your sacrifice worthwhile

The fan blades on the ceiling spin but the air is never cold
And even though you are next to me I still feel so alone
I just can't give you anything for you to call your own

And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?
My heart's sinking like a weight

Something I've been keeping locked away behind my lips
I can feel it breaking free with each and every kiss
I couldn't bear to hurt you but it's all so different now
Things that I was sure of, they have filled me up with doubt

And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?
My heart's sinking like a weight
I can feel you breathing
It's keeping me awake
Could you stop my heart? It's always beating
Sinking like a weight

How am I supposed to feel about the things I've done?
I don't know if i should stay or turn around and run
I know that I hurt you, things will never be the same
The only love I ever knew, I threw it all away

And I can feel you breathing

You forget where the heart is
Answer ""no"" to these questions
Let her go, learn a lesson
It's not me, you're not listening
Now, can't you see? Something's missing
You forget where the heart is

Take you away
From that empty apartment you stay
And forget where the heart is, someday
If ever you loved me you'd say ""it's okay""

Waking up from this nightmare
How's your life? What's it like there?
Is it all what you want it to be?
Does it hurt when you think about me
And how broken my heart is?


It's okay to be angry and never let go
It only gets harder the more that you know
When you get lonely, if no one's around
You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down
We came together, but you left alone
And I know how it feels to walk out on your own
Maybe some day I will see you again
And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend"

I never wanted it to end this way

Even if i wanted to
I don't think that I'd get to you
There's nothing i can say to you to make you feel alive again

Here. A little jealousy
I hope you think of me
Hope you wonder where i sleep at night (sleep at night)
Cause i feel like I'm inside out
You got me upside down
Maybe i was holding on too tight

Even if i wanted to
I don't think that I'd get to you
There's nothing i can say to you to make you feel alive again
So don't just say goodbye to me
Just turn your back away and leave
And if you're lucky i will be your last regret, your only friend

The two of us we dream like one
The two of us, the two of us
The two of us take breath like one
The two of us, the two of us

I guess that this is over now
I guess it's called the falling out
But everyday i'm learning how to make it through this life i'm in"

I may be leaving but you're always in my heart

Nothing i can do about it, nothing i can say
To bring us back to where we were when life was not this hard (life was not this hard)
Looking back it all just seems so far, so far away

A place that i can share with you

I can tell that you don't know me anymore
It's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget
And being on this road is anything but sure
Maybe we'll forget, i hope we don't forget


So many nights, legs tangled tight
Wrap me up in a dream with you
Close up these eyes, try not to cry
All that i've got to pull me through is memories of you

Won't you sing me to sleep?
And fly through my dreams
So I can hitch a ride with you tonight
And get away from this place
Get a new name and face
I just ain't the same without you in my life

Late night drives
All alone in my car
I can't help but start
Singing lines from all our favorite songs
And melodies in the air
Singing ""Life just ain't fair""
Sometimes I still just can't believe you're gone

And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here

Feel your fire
When it's cold in my heart
And things sorta start
Reminding me of my last night with you
I only need one more day
Just one more chance to say
""I wish that I had gone up with you too""

And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here
You won't be coming back
And I didn't get to say goodbye (goodbye)
I really wish I'd got to say goodbye

And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here

I hope that all is well in heaven
Cause it's all shot to hell down here
I hope that I find you in heaven
Cause I'm so lost without you down here

Wouldn't let me write about
My opinions about the state
And the freedom of expression
They would never tolerate
And the military secrets
I never did steal
I didn't start no violence, no
There was nobody that I killed, no

My only weapon
I call poetry

And liberty I was sworn

Who gets rolled

The Bouncing Souls,Anchors Aweigh,Anchors Aweigh,08/26/2003,"Anchors aweigh, my friends
I'll see you another day
I'm going away
Experiences have to come
And the past has got to go
Back into our dreams
Back into our dreams
Anchors aweigh, my friends
Everybody understands
That good times
That good times come and they go
And together we will always go
Back into our dreams
Back into our dreams
And our troubles, we can't leave them behind
But the wind blows and blows them all away
And the road goes and takes them all away
Back into our dreams"
The Bouncing Souls,I'm From There,Anchors Aweigh,08/26/2003,"When we were two brothers forever through the dark and light
We had our fights against the world, against each other
We traveled in the night
So many roads, so many shows together
Far apart we grew, isolated but still together
When we were two brothers forever through the dark and light
We had our fights against ourselves, against each other
We were afraid, afraid of so many things
It was a fight to overcome ourselves and see clearer
We are two brothers forever through the dark and light
We had our fights against the world, against each other
Time has opened my heart
I don't want to hold on to that past
I don't want to live in isolation anymore
There's nothing left to do, but to kiss that life goodbye
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
We are two brothers forever through the dark and light
We had our fights against ourselves, against each other
There's nothing left to do, but to kiss that life goodbye
Goodbye...
Goodbye...

Leaves fall down around me
They're smashing off my face
Like Orange and Yellow lights
I've entered a new place
I've walked these street 1,000 times before
I never saw them this way
A perfect end and a new beginning
Every step of the way
Colors seem so much more true
My eyes must be on fire
I feel each steps vibration
Stab into my soul
A tornado of light surrounds me
Picks me up off my feet
The world is just a blink of light
It can't hold me anymore"
The Bouncing Souls,Kids And Heroes,Anchors Aweigh,08/26/2003,"Hey, where have you gone?
You used to be the one that we looked up to
It seemed like nothing could break you down
How high was your price and was it worth it?
Nothing in life is a sure bet anyway, you're gone
I guess you weren't here from the start
In the end, it's all a question of heart
Hey, where have you gone?
You used to be the one that we looked up to
It seemed like nothing could break you down
How high was your price and was it worth it?
Nothing in life is a sure bet anyway, you're gone
I guess you weren't here from the start
In the end, it's all a question of heart
Hey, where did it go?
Everything we fought for and everything it meant
Maybe we were just naive, but I still believe
There are only a few things that really belong to me
Who I am, who I was
And who I want to be
Hey, where have I gone?
I used to be the one looking for the hero in some far off place
Blindly ever forward, never knowing all along
The truth was right there in my own song"
The Bouncing Souls,Night Train,Anchors Aweigh,08/26/2003,"Goodbye to me and you, goodbye to the life we knew
One last long embrace, then go and walk on through
I'm leaving everything behind for a peace that I can't find
Ghosts that roam this house, winter air right through our souls
And it feels like dying
It just feels like time to go
Going down south to dream another dream
Maybe check out Memphis, Tennessee
Take the night train with an extra pair of jeans
Can't think of anything else I really need
All my experiences ride with me
This town is dead to me and
I can't stop chasing my dreams
I love you more than anything
But what you want I can never be
I love you more than anything
But I'll be alone, can't we both be free?
Goodbye to me and you
Goodbye to the life we knew
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Then go and walk on through"
The Bouncing Souls,Sing Along Forever,Anchors Aweigh,08/26/2003,"I'm driving, listening to my radio
Checking out the airwaves for something to believe in
Give me something to hold true
Give me something to sing about
Give me a reason to care
I'll sing along forever
Watered-down words covered in song
Trying to hide the truth
That life is beautiful
Or life is pain, give it to me straight
Touch my heart
I'll sing along forever
I'll sing along forever
I'll sing along forever
I'm driving, listening to my radio
Checking out the airwaves for something to believe in

Asleep at the wheel forty miles left to go
Rolling in on fumes to rock the show

We don't need bright lights to spell our name
All we ever wanted was to play

Play it loud, play it loud
Raise your voice, shout it out

We weren't the first but we're holding our own
Ten long years ago the seeds were sown
A song in your heart picks you up when you're down
We like the songs we play we love this sound
We're just like you straight from the crowd

Play it loud, play it loud
Raise your voice, shout it out
Play it loud, play it loud
Raise your voice, shout it out

Hold fast to your friends
Be true to yourself
And stop trying to be just like somebody else

Be yourself

Every time I do
I get shaken inside and the sun in my eyes
I'll stay away
I'd rather be here
Than anywhere with you
Whoo
I'd be dancing with your ghost
Toasting note to note
So here's to the passing
Of all that could be
Between you and me
I'd rather be here
Than anywhere with you
Whoo
I know I can not see you
Even if I wanted to
'cause your light is the light of ten sunsets
Circled by eyes, burned blue and opened wide
I'd rather be here
Than anywhere with you
Whoo
I'd rather be here
Than anywhere with you
Whoo"
Saves the Day,Driving in the Dark,In Reverie,09/16/2003,"Life leaks from your fingertips, onto sparkling pavement
Having heard the news, you stumble, stuttering, confused
Helicopters line the sky
Marching men are rolling by
Babies in their baskets blankly stare through space, hey, hey

Ever since I first saw you
Standing in the black frozen night
I've been blind
But I'm driving in the dark towards you
Not stopping 'til I catch the sunlight
In my eyes

Sirens sing over the streets
Chimpanzees are on TV
Everybody's working, waiting for the week to end

Ever since I first saw you
Standing in the black frozen night
I've been blind
But I'm driving in the dark towards you
Not stopping 'til I catch the sunlight
In my eyes
And nothing's left to hide
Ever since I first saw you
Standing in the black frozen night
I've been blind
I'm running out of time
Ever since I first saw you
Standing in the black frozen night
I've been blind
But I'm driving in the dark towards you
Not stopping 'til I catch the sunlight
In my eyes
And nothing's left to hide"

Where we began

Smell of burning photographs slide slowly to my nostrils
I try remembering the soft silence of summer
Sweating in the evening

So once again, I swim in reverie

Wind blows through a hole in the roof
Brings your perfume like lilies to me
And all I can do is remember you

When was the last time I held you all through the night?
Feels like a zillion years and I don't wanna wait more
To find you is to lose you
What is that for?
Tell me


When was the last time I held you all through the night?
Never a worry would run through my heart like a knife
Feels like a zillion years and I don't wanna wait more
To find you is to lose you
What is that for?
One more night and I might never know who you are

When was the last time I held you all through the night?

No color you're all dressed in
And a stab in the back
Left you bleeding on the floor
And I'm mourning the death
The recent passing of your insides
I smile in regret
Every time I think of how I spoke to you
I put it all in back
Of my mind where I hold you
I'm just trying to keep track
How far back it really goes
And I'm living in lack
Of the blood sent from the heavens
I'm just trying to relax
As a killer's waiting right outside my door
What's black and white?
What's red all over?
This tired book
This organ donor
Sweet blasphemy, my giving tree
It hasn't rained in years
I bring to you this sacrificial offering
Of virgin ears
Leave it to me, I'll remain free
From all the comforts of home
And where that is, I'm pleased as piss to say
I'll never really know
I put 'em all in black
The four walls of my bedroom
And I trimmed them in red
Peeled your picture off the wall
And I'm living in lack
Of the blood sent from your heartbeat
That arrived in your neck
Every time I salivated over you
What's upside down?
What's coated in silver?
This crucifix is
My four leaf clover
Sweet blasphemy, my giving tree
It hasn't rained in years
I bring to you this sacrificial offering
Of virgin ears
Leave it to me, I'll remain free
From all the comforts of home
And where that is, I'm pleased as piss to say
I'll never really know

Throwing looks like those around
And one of these nights, I promise to you
I'll soon be sleeping sound, as soon as I leave town"

The Offspring,Spare Me the Details,Splinter,12/09/2003,"My girlfriend, my dumb donut
Went out to a party just the other night
But three hours later and seven shots of J'ger
She was in the bedroom with another guy

And I don't really wanna know
So don't tell me anymore
And I really don't wanna hear
About her feet all up in the air

And well, I'm not the one who acted like a hoe
Why must I be the one who has to know?
I'm not the one who messed up big time
So, spare me the details if you don't mind

Now I can understand friends who wanna tell me
Think they're gonna help me open up my eyes
But the play-by-play makes me wanna lose it
Every time you do it, man, it turns the knife

And I don't really wanna know
So don't tell me anymore
And I really don't wanna hear
About her feet all up in the air

And well, I'm not the one who acted like a hoe
Why must I be the one who has to know?
I'm not the one who messed up big time
So, spare me the details if you don't mind

Now I don't need to hear about the sounds they were making
And I don't need to hear about how long it was taking
Or how the walls, they were shaking

Now lying in bed, wallowing in sorrow
Missing the tomorrow that we could have had
Running through my head, over and over
Things I never told her now just make me sad
And it drives me insane, sitting with the vision
Stuck with that image burned into my brain
And I feel so dumb that I could ever trust her
While someone else fucked her, then walked away

And I don't really wanna to know
So don't tell me anymore
And I really don't wanna hear
About her feet all up in the air

And so, I'm not the one who acted like a hoe
Why must I be the one who has to know?
I'm not the one who messed up big time
So, spare me the details if you don't mind

And in the night we'll wish this never ends

The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

New Found Glory,Truth Of My Youth,Catalyst,05/18/2004,"There was a time and place
Where i never thought
I'd leave my own hometown
But those days finally
Are dead and gone
It was never my intention to stay there
Oh no
There was a conscious effort played by me
To disown anything I see
There was a girl I knew
Way back when
Who says she doesn't know me anymore
These are the lies the things you never mention
These are my past mistakes I'll stay away from

These are my thoughts written down on paper
It's my only savior
From not saying what I want to say
These are the thoughts that are on my mind
Moments that haven't yet been defined
And I don't know if you could ever understand
These are the things I can't say when we're alone

There were countless hours on the telephone
My ears were ringing from the dial tone
There were flashing lights
People staring
There was nothing i could ever do
These are the lies the things you never mention
These are my past mistakes I'll stay away from
This is the truth
The only time you'll hear it
I write it down because it seems so hard to say it"
Bad Religion,Let Them Eat War,The Empire Strikes First,06/08/2004,"There's a prophet on a mountain and he's making up dinner
With long division and a riding crop
Anybody can feel like a winner when it's served up piping hot
But the people aren't looking for a handout
They're America's working corps
Can this be what they voted for?

Let them eat war, let them eat war
That's how to ration the poor
Let them eat war, let them eat war
There's an urgent need to feed, declining pride

From the force to the union shops
The war economy is making new jobs
But the people who benefit most
Are breaking bread with their benevolent hosts
Who never stole from the rich to give to the poor
All they ever gave to them was a war
And a foreign enemy to deplore

Let them eat war, let them eat war
That's how to ration the poor
Let them eat war, let them eat war
There's an urgent need to feed, declining pride

We've got to kill 'em and eat 'em before they reach for their checks
Squeeze some blue collars, let them bleed from their necks
Seize a few dollars from the people who sweat
Cause it's freedom or debt and they won't question it
At a job site the boss is godlike
Conditioned workhorses park at a stoplight
Seasoned vets with their feet in nets
A stones throw away from a rock fight but not tonight
(Feed 'em death) Here comes another ration
(Feed 'em death) 'Cause they're the finest in the nation
(Feed 'em death) When there's nothing left to feed them with
When it's freedom or it's death

Let them eat war, let them eat war
That's how to ration the poor
Let them eat war, let them eat war
There's an urgent need to feed, declining pride"
Bad Religion,Los Angeles Is Burning,The Empire Strikes First,06/08/2004,"Somewhere high in the desert near a curtain of blue
Saint Ann's skirts are billowing
But down here in the city of limelights
The fans of Santa Ana are withering
And you can't deny that living is easy
If you never look behind the scenery
It's showtime for dry climes and
Bedlam is dreaming of rain

When the hills of Los Angeles are burning
Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
So many lives are on the breeze, even the stars are ill at ease
And Los Angeles is burning

This is not a test
Of the emergency broadcast system
When Malibu fires and radio towers
Conspire to dance again
And I cannot believe the media Mecca
They're only trying to peddle reality
Catch it on prime time, story at 9
The whole world is going insane

When the hills of Los Angeles are burning
Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
So many lives are on the breeze, even the stars are ill at ease
And Los Angeles is burning

A placard reads the end of days
Jacaranda boughs are bending in the haze
More a question than a curse, how could hell be any worse?
The flames are starting, the camera's running, so take warning

When the hills of Los Angeles are burning
Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
So many lives are on the breeze, even the stars are ill at ease
And Los Angeles is burning"

That tonight you should grant me this one wish
Like the one year of my life that I gave to you and
Now you put me through hell
You break me up, yeah
Whoa, I should hate you
But I can't replace you in my heart
Why am I so pathetic?
I don't get it
Why you won't return my calls
Can't you look at me once?
And please if you got a minute
Enjoy this lonely sky with me
It'll swallow us whole if we only let it
If I could only see you now for about an hour
Maybe just a minute

Is it his brown eyes?
Well, I'll give you a thousand reasons
That tonight you should grant me this one wish

Survey the scene
Finding two of the tallest trees
And I'll tie myself up
Above the cool earth
To dangle in the twilight
Oo-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I'm gonna get to the bottom of this
Gonna peel back my skin
And look at myself shaking and shivering
And as my skin collects in a pile on the ground
I'll radiate heat
And turn off my head
And just pretend that I don't exist
That I'll see clearly to the end
Of the ropes that i've been hanging from (woa-oh-oh)
As they loosen from the trees
I plummet to the ground to be impaled
And turned around (turn me right around)
Finally free from the ups and downs
And I'm gonna get to the bottom of this
Gonna peel back my skin
And look at myself shaking and shivering
And I'm gonna get to the bottom of this
Gonna peel back my skin
And look at myself shaking and shivering"

All! To! Blame!

How can we still succeed taking what we don't need?
Telling lies, alibis, selling all the hate that we breed
Super-size our tragedies (you can't define me, or justify greed)
Bought in the land of the free, (land, free)

And we're all to blame
We've gone too far, from pride to shame
We're trying so hard
We're dying in vain
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
To all we are
We want it all
With no sacrifice!

Stand to salute, say thanks to the man of the year
How did we all come to this? (you can't define me, or justify greed)
A greed that we just can't resist (resist)

Tell me now
What have we done

I can't allow
What has begun to tear me down, believe me now
We have no choice left with our backs against the wall!

And now
We're all to blame
We've gone too far
From pride to shame
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
When all we need
Is something true to believe
Don't we all

I am standing all alone
Please call me only
If you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live

In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope

There's a glow of light
The Saint Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust

What the hell's your name? (Ooh)
What's your pleasure and what is your pain? (Ooh)
Do you dream too much? (Ooh)
Do you think what you need is a crutch?

In the crowd of pain
Saint Jimmy comes without any shame
He says, 'We're fucked up, but we're not the same
And Mom and Dad are the ones you can blame.""

Jimmy died today (Ooh)
He blew his brains out into the bay (Ooh)
In the state of mind (Ooh)
It's my own private suicide

Well nobody cares, well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well nobody cares, well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?

Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on East 12th Street
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world and he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
His life's on the line with anxiety now
She had enough and he had plenty

Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here

So far away, I don't wanna stay (Ah-ha, la, la, la)

This life-like dream ain't for me!

After ten cups of coffee and you're still not here
Dreaming of a song, but something went wrong
And you can't tell anyone, 'cause no one's here
Left me here alone and I should have stayed home
After ten cups of coffee I'm thinking

Nobody likes you, everyone left you (Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you, havin' fun (Where'd you go?)
Everyone left you, nobody likes you (Where'd you go?)

I got a rock and roll band, I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend and another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house, I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums, and I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York, I got a kid in the Bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin' in over 22 days (Don't want to be an American idiot!)
So get off my case, off of my case
Off of my case!

Hey!

Here they come, marching down the street (Ooh-ooh)
Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat (Ooh-ooh)
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
The time has come and it's goin' nowhere (Ooh-ooh)
Nobody ever said that life was fair now (Ooh-ooh)
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bare
In the summer heat

The world is spinning 'round
And 'round, out of control again
The 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letterbomb
And visit me in Hell
We're the ones going

Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again

(Ooh) I started fuckin' running
As soon as my feet touched ground
(Ooh) We're back in the barrio
And to you and me, that's Jingle Town, that's

Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again

Wake me up when September ends

Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side

A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers

To alcohol and cigarettes
And Mary Jane to keep me insane
Doing someone else's cocaine

I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
That the center of the Earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less

City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care (Hey!)

I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care!
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care!
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care!
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care!
I don't care!

Everyone's so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia

Land of make believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make believe (Sons, it's another lie!)
And I don't believe
And I don't care
(Woo, woo, woo) I don't care
(Woo, woo, woo) I don't care
(Woo, woo, woo) I don't care
(Woo, woo, woo) I don't care

Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure

Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse

To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies

I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
The lights of masochists

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time

I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain when you've been victimized
Tales from another broken home
You're leaving
You're leaving
You're leaving
Ah, you're leaving home"
Green Day,Letterbomb,American Idiot [Japan Bonus Tracks],09/20/2004,"Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They're all out without you
Having fun

Where have all the bastards gone?
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collecting unemployment checks
Like a flunkie only along for the ride
Where have all the riots gone
As the city's motto gets pulverized?
What's in love is now in debt
On your birth certificate
So strike the fucking match to light this fuse!

The town bishop's an extortionist
And he don't even know that you exist
Standing still when it's do or die
You better run for your fucking life

It's not over 'till you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burnin'
It's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late
There is nothing left to analyze

Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself?
And where will we all go when it's too late?

And don't look back

You're not the Jesus of Suburbia
The St. Jimmy is a figment of
Your father's rage and your mother's love
Made me the idiot America

It's not over 'till you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burnin'
It's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late

I'm leaving it behind""
Well she said ""I can't take this town
I'm leaving you tonight"""
Green Day,She's a Rebel,American Idiot [Japan Bonus Tracks],09/20/2004,"She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction

From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they call ol' Whatsername
She's the symbol of resistance
And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade

Is she dreaming what I'm thinking?
Is she the mother of all bombs? Gonna detonate
Is she trouble like I'm trouble?
Make it a double twist of fate or a melody

She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Nothing comes to mind

She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous

Green Day,St. Jimmy,American Idiot [Japan Bonus Tracks],09/20/2004,"St. Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Light of a silhouette, he's insubordinate
Coming at you on the count of 1,2- 1,2,3,4!

My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out
Suicide commando that your momma talked about
King of the forty thieves, and I'm here to represent
The needle in the vein of the establishment

I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe
Raised in the city under a halo of lights
The product of war and fear that we've been victimized

I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

Are you talking to me?
I'll give you something to cry about
St. Jimmy!

My name is St. Jimmy, I'm a son of a gun
I'm the one that's from the way outside
I'm a teenage assassin executing some fun
In the cult of the life of crime
I'd really hate to say it but I told you so
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down, ol' boy
Welcome to the club and give me some blood
I'm the resident leader of the lost and found

It's comedy and tragedy
It's St. Jimmy
And that's my name
And don't wear it out!"
Green Day,Whatsername,American Idiot [Japan Bonus Tracks],09/20/2004,"Thought I ran into you down on the street
Then it turned out to only be a dream

I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been

Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry old Whatshisface?

I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been

Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
Remember, whatever

The regrets are useless in my mind
She's in my head, I must confess
The regrets are useless in my mind
She's in my head from so long ago

And in the darkest night
If my memory serves me right
I'll never turn back time
Forgetting you, but not the time"
Tsunami Bomb,4 Robots and an Evil Scientist,The Definitive Act,09/21/2004,"What you did to us was inexcusable
You disappointing, sallow scab
Took advantage of us got your way
Abused us, almost destroyed all we had

You took my passion

You begin to fantasize about how much money you'll be owed

Tsunami Bomb,A Lonely Chord,The Definitive Act,09/21/2004,"I never thought it mattered
Never thought it mattered so much
To me exactly where I put my feet
I was wrong
I drink a strong cup of coffee
A long time ago, I had a home
A corner where I could be alone
So goodbye my solid ground
I'm an engine, I won't break down
A lonely chord without a song
Searching for an orchestration where I belong
Where will I hang up my raincoat when this day is over?
Like a leaf without a tree
Nothing to cover over me
I'm like a character from a story
I don't exist
I owe a lot to these kids who are like family
They've helped me out with their endless generosity"

Nobody knows what's in your future
Though death and unhappiness are certain
But one thing I can say for sure;
Honesty's the perfect cure for any stress-induced disease you have
Believe what you do is right
Explain your reasonings
And everything will be alright

Tsunami Bomb,Dawn On A Funeral Day,The Definitive Act,09/21/2004,"Did you ever realize why there are no stars in the sky?
Because they're on the ground
The air is brown
We're trapped in this town
Let me go - I can't breathe
I drag myself through the debris
I never felt more alone than on this starry road
The air is warm but I feel grey
The chill of dawn on a funeral day
(I lie in unrest) While heavy dirt falls to my chest
(I fade away) And the hollow phantoms stay
Imagination in a chokehold, I've been steamrolled by gold records
Inspectors are watching over me, under lock and key
Chalk my outline; they'd talk of this if I'd died from a broken heart
They've taken art, turned it to something they think (We'll buy)
The air is warm but I feel grey
The chill of dawn on a funeral day
(I lie in unrest) While heavy dirt falls to my chest
(I fade away) And the hollow phantoms stay
My blood is their liquid vitamin
Their madness festers under their skin
The air is warm but I feel grey
The chill of dawn on a funeral day
(I lie in unrest) While heavy dirt falls to my chest
(I fade away) And the hollow phantoms stay
I have never felt so alone in my whole life"

What have you done?
Your life isn't for you anymore
Where have you gone?
Your old self is easy to ignore
You surrendered
Just follow the path they've laid out
You pretend to be happy
I want you back so I'll point out:
This is not about our future
It's about what we do now
Nothing is more real than life
And you have the right to be yourself in the crowd
I will miss you
I'm not good enough for you
No spring in your step
Your shining fire has been put out
Sealed yourself in
Nothing can affect your thick skin
I can't get through to you
And now you'll never learn anything new
You look around, creativity dead
You're missing out on the blues and reds
You're fucking blind!
Your brain has been immersed in whitewash"

No harm meant
Let's keep it that way
I'm quite content knowing that I don't know you -
I can pretend
Let's keep it that way

I don't want you going and screwing it up with your personality

I realized what I wanted to say:
Come what may

It's a marathon
I might be gone soon

I drop my machete to the floor
You look so happy-sad
I know I can't expect you'll wait for me
The soft taste of your lips
Conjures memories of a world
Where petals fall from above
It seems so far away
I am lost, to both of our dismay
Oh, I don't want to hurt you anymore
I drop my machete to the floor
You look so happy-sad
I know I can't expect you'll wait for me
Would someone please pass me the key
To this exam that I've written?

And why we should care
Songs stay with your your whole life
Remind you of time spent and time gone
Carry you through dismal days
And help you to carry on
I owe so many positive times to my favorite songs
It can be more than just sounds and words -
It can be something that saves you
From yourself
Your thoughts
Your life
Your world
It can be more than a favorite line -
It can be something that shapes you when you're young
But give you freedom at the same time"
Tsunami Bomb,Safety Song,The Definitive Act,09/21/2004,"We were in the graveyard
Shovel in hand and digging
Took one step in the hole
And realized it wasn't our time to go
We still had a lot of work, work to do
We took cement and filled up that grave again
Just like new
At the supermarket
Didn't know just what we needed
We searched high and low
Then found what it was on aisle 10
The perfect ingredient for our dead end
To no surprise, it was quite expensive
But worth the spend
Let's not try to foresee what happens now
All we know is that we're happy somehow
The timing was just right
Nowhere to go but forward now
We only have one rule
Freedom always allowed"

For some reason, no one has any advice to be told

No, I have to go, leave my old self behind
No, I have to know and solve what's on my mind
Promise that I will figure something out this time
No, I have to go

I suppose I wanted a change
So this is what I deserve
I know that I'm the one to blame
Whenever my stomach turns
In between each sad song
The happy ones are just as sour
They only remind me of
How all the days and nights were ours
 
So now I drive around alone, and I...
Don't get me wrong, I know it's all my fault

No, I have to go, leave my old self behind
No, I have to know and solve what's on my mind

Turned out were never even true

Some say we're better off without
Knowing what life is all about
I'm sure they'll never realize the way
It's too late
Somehow it's different everyday
In some ways it never fades away

I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please, I taste you all over my teeth
Never again. Just tonight? Okay

I can picture your face well from the bar in my hotel
I wish I'd go to you
I'll pick up, put down the phone

So go on, love
Leave while there's still hope for escape
You gotta take what you can these days

Do you feel bad, like I feel bad?
We'll pour us a road, we'll both drink and drive

Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
Leave you with the love we made

Come alive on the driver's side
So close I taste your breath
Your lips go dry, but they're sweet inside
Wine must go right to your head
It'd be easy if you get mad
But three fingers point back to you
We could stay here
Stay out all night
No one will know
Us and the moonlight

Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
Leave you with the love we made

I set my watch by a street-side clock
A needle in echo groove
You pierce my heart like a willing arm
Your ticking makes my blood move
There's no way out this fade out
Be happy to get what you do
Make him notice with both fists
'Cause quitting alone will never get you dry
Never get you dry

Give me everything you've got now
I don't feel a single thing
Drag me out into the cold rain
Let it hover over me
Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face

I feel that when I'm old
I'll look at you and know the world was beautiful

Then you tell me

You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go, I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me

I'm done, there's nothing left to show
I try but can't let it go
Are you happy where you're standing still?
Do you really want the sugar pill?
I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll start
Tonight it feels so hard
As the train approaches Gare Du Nord
As I'm sure your kiss remains employed
Am I only dreaming?

You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go, I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me

When you go, I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me"
Jimmy Eat World,The World You Love,Futures,10/19/2004,"I got a story, it's almost finished
Now all I need is someone to tell it to
Maybe that's you
Our time is borrowed and spent too freely
Every minute I have needs to be made up
But how?
I'm looking for a nice way to say, ""I'm out.""
I want out

I fall asleep with my friends around me
Only place I know, I feel safe
I'm going to call this home
The open road is still miles away
Hey, nothing serious
We still have our fun
Oh, we had it once

But windows open and close
That's just how it goes

Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love, forever gone
We're only just as happy as everyone else seems to think we are

I'm in love with the ordinary
I need a simple space
And rest my head
And everything gets clear
Well I'm a little ashamed for asking
But just a little helps
It gets me straight again
Helps me get over it, over it

It might seem like a dream
But it's real to me

Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we loved, forever gone
We're only just as happy as everyone else seems to think we are

You should see the canals are freezing
You should see me high
You should just be here
Be with me here
It doesn't seem there's hope for me
I let you down
But I won't give in now
Not for any amount

Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love, forever gone
We're only just as happy as everyone else thinks
Now, don't that feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love, forever gone
We're only just as happy as everyone else seems to think we are"

Green Day,Boulevard of Broken Dreams,American Idiot [Japan Bonus Tracks],11/29/2004,"I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me

When's it ever not?
The love we make is give and it's take
I'm game to play along

All I can say, I should've said

Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time

The best DJs are saving their slowest song for last
When the dance is through, it's me and you
Come on, would it really be so bad?
The things we think might be the same
But I won't fight for more
It's just not me to wear it on my sleeve
Count on that for sure

Get out of this place while we still have time
You want to take a ride?

To keep me safe for awhile
I think I'm gonna go hide myself
Behind hot water and tile
Every decade they say it's getting worse
I don't know if it's true or a cynical curse
But it's bearing down on me constantly
And pretty soon now, I think it's gonna burst
I'm not coming out of the shower
It's such a comfortable crutch
It's a warm loving womb, an intoxicating tomb
And I don't miss the outside world that much
Now all my harshest critics
Are screaming for murder
But I'm doing what we've done all along
I'm just taking it one step further
I've always been a good American
I drank a lot of soda and I didn't question
In whose deft hand the grenade was in
And now I feel someone is gonna pull the pin"

The dreams I've had
The open fields
The friendly kiss so natural

Those Latin globes behind soft hands
Like satin robes and Iberian sands
One more missed chance as I talk to her
It's lost, why bother!?!"

There's a pivot point in time now that a trail of yesterdays cannot erase
And it's never going to be the same again
And I'm not sure if that's a bad thing
No more innocence, a sense of fear has taken hold
Or maybe it's uncertainty of a brave new future untold
And it's never going to be the same again
And I'm not sure if that's a good thing
And if you pray to God
Ask her where she was

I'm just searching for a because"

And now I'm having my doubts
It seems that broken hearted love songs are what I'm all about
So while I'm sore from the smiles that you've given to me
I just can't wait for the day when inevitably
You say I'm not the guy you thought you knew when we have ""The Talk""
And you'll regrettably inform me that you're taking a walk
I'm so in love with you
But I just don't know what to do
It seems I lose my inspiration when my hearts not unglued
So now I welcome the pain
Oh yeah I'm praying for rain
To bring some dark black cloudy sadness to this warm sunny day
So while I'm sore from the smiles that you've given to me
I just can't wait for the day when inevitably
You say I'm not the guy you thought you knew when we have ""The Talk""
And you'll regrettably inform me that you're taking a walk
And I could write you the perfect song
And you could sing along
Yeah you could sing along
And I could write you the perfect song
About how everything's gone wrong
And you could sing along"

Running down the hallways of your dreams
Howling at the sickly silver moon

Gathers when the stars are out
Always in the audience
With their executions of the innocent
Can you see them?
You could be them
Oh there a jolly bunch
And they're coming after you
But if you give into them
You will become one of them
So much fun, can't we come to the vampire party with you
Always by the side of the road
Rushing passing lanes at night
Hidden in the corners of the room
High from the glare of your flood light
Listen to their voices in the gloom
Whispering their worlds devoid of truth
See them sitting on a fence
Croaking like crows in the wind
Can you see them
You could be them
Oh there a jolly bunch and there coming after you
But if you give into them
You will become one of them
So much fun, can't we come to the vampire party with you"
A Day to Remember,Heartless,And Their Name Was Treason,01/22/2005,"For once my eyes are open to you, and everything you've said
For once your web of lies is in the open
I gave you everything I had, until I had nothing left
Still you act as if I'm just a burden
I've finally let go. Let go, let go

Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on
Cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart
I've been around the world and back for you, and now it's time to choose

I've been swallowed by this wreck that you call your life
I'm damaged from the inside. I've been broken
Don't threaten me with what you think I feel
If you could read my mind you'd be in tears

I'm sick of your excuses you hold above me
I've finally come to terms with what I am
I'm nothing in your eyes, and this will not change
I'm living in a dream

Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on
Cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart
I've been around the world and back for you, and now it's time to choose

And I'll close my eyes, and dream of a better time
When I'll be finally past this and I'll be happy on my own
I've done all I can, and I've still been cast aside
All I ever wanted to be was be the one who would wipe tears from your eyes
But I guess I'll play second best, to a world that will never care about you
You'll never understand you're just another pretty face
You'll tell me that you care, and then run straight back to him
I can hear your voice of treason from a mile away

You never did know how to whisper

You're such a liar. Tell me the truth
You're such a liar. Tell me the truth
You're such a liar. Tell me the truth
Do the world a favor, stop cutting your arms, and slit your throat"

Step up, step up, step up

Nothing you say today
Is gonna bring me down
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say

Won't bring me down
Bring me down (Shut up, shut up, shut up)
Won't bring me

Simple Plan,Untitled (How Could This Happen to Me?),Still Not Getting Any...,04/01/2005,"I open my eyes
I try to see, but I'm blinded by the white light
I can't remember how, I can't remember why
I'm lying here tonight
And I can't stand the pain
And I can't make it go away
No, I can't stand the pain

How could this happen to me?
I've made my mistakes
Got nowhere to run
The night goes on as I'm fading away
I'm sick of this life
I just wanna scream
How could this happen to me?

Everybody's screaming
I try to make a sound, but no one hears me
I'm slipping off the edge, I'm hanging by a thread
I wanna start this over again
So I try to hold on to a time when nothing mattered
And I can't explain what happened
And I can't erase the things that I've done
No, I can't

How could this happen to me?
I've made my mistakes
Got nowhere to run
The night goes on as I'm fading away
I'm sick of this life
I just wanna scream
How could this happen to me?

I've made my mistakes
Got nowhere to run
The night goes on as I'm fading away
I'm sick of this life
I just wanna scream

Take my advice 'cause we are bad news

Into your notebook (Spit lines like these!)

A Day to Remember,1958,And Their Name Was Treason,05/10/2005,"And shepherds we shall be
For thee my lord for thee
Power hath descended forth from thy hand
That our feet may swiftly carry out thy command
So we shall flow river forth to thee
And teeming with souls shall it ever be
In nomine patris
Et filli
Et spiritus sancti

You've sunk lower than I've ever seen
And even though you deserved this
I tried to catch your fall
I've grown so tired of your childish threats
Know that I'll never run from anything

And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive

Here's where we prove all your fairytales wrong
This all stops tonight
Swim in your sea of smoke
Until your lungs lose the fight
It's over
This all stops tonight
Or prove me wrong

What have you become through your jealousy?
You've threatened my life, my friends and family
This is your last wrong turn in your life
And this dead end leads to a blood bath
Your blood bath

And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive

Here's where we prove all your fairytales wrong
This all stops tonight
Swim in your sea of smoke
Until your lungs lose the fight
It's over
This all stops tonight
Or prove me wrong

You'll never stop us with your one-man army
We would burn him alive
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
If you're such a man then bring the fight
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
We would burn him alive
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
If you're such a man then bring the fight

This is me calling you out
You want to talk like a man, then be a man
Stop talking like you're something (We're paging 1958)
You always have so much to say but it's never to our faces
I'm right here (We're paging 1958)
We're all one and the same
We're moving on, and living our dreams (We're paging 1958)

A Day to Remember,You Had Me At Hello,And Their Name Was Treason,05/10/2005,"I'm missing you so much, I'll say you died tonight
Just so I can get to you before the sun will rise
I know these times are hard and I feel this too
None of that ever seems to matter when I'm holding you

And I'm wasting away, away from you
And I'm wasting away, away from you

What have I gotten into this time around
I know that I had sworn I'd never trust
Anyone again but I didn't have to
You had me at hello

I've never seen a smile that can light the room like yours
It's simply radiant, I see it more with every day that goes by
I watch the clock to make my timing just right
Would it be okay?
Would it be okay if I took your breath away?

And I'm wasting away, away from you
And I'm wasting away, away from you

What have I gotten into this time around
I know that I had sworn I'd never trust
Anyone again but I didn't have to
You had me at hello

A Day to Remember,You Should've Killed Me When You Had The Chance,And Their Name Was Treason,05/10/2005,"So I say goodbye to a town that has ears and eyes
I can hear you whispering as I walk by
Familiar faces smiling back at me and I knew
This would make them change

The only thing that's going to bother me
Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends
Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?

The writings on the wall, you've read that I'll be gone, but if you call my name
Just know that I'll come running, for one more night to spare with you
This is where I'm meant to be, please don't leave me

I've read these stories a thousand times, and now I'll rewrite them all
You're meddling in an anger you can't control
She means the world to me, so hold your serpent tongue
Is a whores lies worth dying for? Trust me, I'm done

The only thing that's going to bother me
Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends
Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?

The writings on the wall, you've read that I'll be gone, but if you call my name
Just know that I'll come running, for one more night to spare with you
This is where I'm meant to be, please don't leave me

I walked into your house this morning
I brought the gun from our end table
Your blood was strewn across the walls
They'll find you on your bathroom floor
I walked into your house this morning
I brought the gun from our end table
Your blood was strewn across the walls
They'll find you on your bathroom floor when I'm done
But should I write it all off?

But should I write it all off?
But should I write it all off?
But should I write it all off?

Alkaline Trio,Fall Victim,Crimson,05/24/2005,"Not sure how this is supposed to feel
Cutting like a red hot knife of surgical steel
Brought fresh from the autoclave
She came, she came with sterile warnings
Screaming from her blade
Singing, I wanna make you bleed
I watched them fall in line, as I fell victim
To double suicide on your television
We heard our records backwards too many times
I'm wasting my breath, we're wasting our time
Down on my knees, but not to pray
Hit so hard across the skull it buckled my legs
They told me I had hell to pay
I came, I came too close to heaven
Had nothing to say for myself
I had to walk away
I watched them fall in line, as I fell victim
To double suicide on your television
We heard our records backwards too many times
I'm wasting my breath, we're wasting our time
Wasting our time, wasting our time
I watched them fall in line, as I fell victim
To double suicide on your television
We heard our records backwards too many times
I'm wasting my breath, we're wasting ours"
MxPx,Heard That Sound,Panic,06/06/2005,"Without a window to see through
I did my time, in here without you
Slept on the floor down in the LEC
Meet me back home under the marque
It seems like misery loves misery
My favourite songs they keep me company
So many memories come down to this
I maybe be lost but i'm not hopeless
I heard that sound a mile away
I heard that sound a mile away
All those things i wish that i could say
I heard that sound a mile away
A mile away
Came in like static off the tv
This kinda thing never goes easy
I meant to tell you but you were gone
I tried to get it right, I got it all wrong
I heard that sound a mile away
I heard that sound a mile away
All those things i wish that i could say
I heard that sound a mile away
A mile away
Sat outside the show
With nowhere else, nowhere else to go
Don't say ""can't see""
It sure does sound, good to me
(Whoa oaaa) Na Na Na Na Na (Whoa oaaa)
Don't save yourself....good to me
(Whoa oa) Na Na Na Na Na
Good to you....good to me

MxPx,Wrecking Hotel Rooms,Panic,06/06/2005,"I wrecked your hotel room
I crashed up the car
Slept in the gutter
I'm outside your door

Saw you through the key hole
Down on your knees
There's really no reason to call the police

Do you hold the phone when you're alone
Imagine that it rings then hold it to your ear
And wish that I was there to sing you off to sleep
Be with you in your dreams for the days I will be gone
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song

I know you don't know me
Cause we've never met
I'm not really crazy
So don't get upset

I've got all these problems
None with solutions
Been in and out of some nice institutions

Do you hold the phone when you're alone
Imagine that it rings then hold it to your ear
And wish that I was there to sing you off to sleep
Be with you in your dreams for the days I will be gone
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song

Do you hold the phone when you're alone
Imagine that it rings then hold it to your ear
And wish that I was there to sing you off to sleep
Be with you in your dreams for the days I will be gone
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song

The Offspring,Can't Repeat,Greatest Hits,06/20/2005,"I woke the other day
And saw my world has changed
The past is over, but tomorrow's wishful thinking
I can't hold onto what's been done
I can't grab onto what's to come
And I'm just wishing I could stop, but

Life goes on, come of age
Can't hold on, turn the page
Time rolls on, wipe these eyes
Yesterday laughs, tomorrow cries

Memories are bittersweet
The good times we can't repeat
Those days are gone and we can never get them back
Now we must move ahead
Despite our fear and dread
We're all just wishing we could stop, but


With all our joys and fears
Wrapped in forgotten years
The past is laughing as today just slips away
Time tears down what we've made
And sets another stage
And I'm just wishing we could stop


Time rolls on"
Alkaline Trio,Time to Waste,Crimson,06/27/2005,"There's someone down below blowing you a kiss
They watch from their windows
As all arms fall to their sides, and all eyes fix
On the death of tomorrow
And you found everything you need
To make a life complete
Completely revolting, and they have safety and relief
For sale up the street
I see you in line everyday
You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill, it's dead and buried
You've got guts to spill, but no one trustworthy
These creatures are waking up in these dark trees
Waiting like vultures
Eyes roll back, turn white in time to feed
They salivate in hunger
For you and everything they need
To make a death complete
Completely unnatural and salvation lies
Behind those dead eyes
That watch you while you sleep every night
And you had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill its dead and buried
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy
You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill its dead and buried

Your teeth are sharpened you have hungry eyes, where did you take us
Your family honor is weak, balloon of loyalty has got a leak, how can I trust you when
I know you'll sell me
You're not more than a monster made of glass please see the truth
And since you're not more than a, a monster made of glass we'll shatter you
We'll shatter you
I have no many friends who deserve so much more
By helping each other we get the force of a wrecking ball smashing up all your teeth
Soon you'll be helpless and we'll be free

That word is avenge from your library of quarterly proceeds"

Ain't nobody around
I've been to your city
Ain't no city like Cincinnati
The first time I've been there
In the rollin heat
I saw black love spent
And angel wings
I saw white dust choke
And kill and end the violence
And I know I'm running the American Dream
Red, White, and Blue blood
Run at the seams
Bitter sweet liberty
Don't mean shit to me
Hey I've been to your town
Ain't nobody around
Hey baby I've been to your city
Ain't no city like Cincinnati
Hey I run along to Mexico
Some water is cold up the coast
You know I bleed the sun
The ressurection
I run along to Ohio
Drive past the grave of an old romance
Never felt more alive than Suicide Cincinnati
Cincinnati
And I've been to your town
Ain't nobody around
Hey baby I've been
To your city
Ain't no city like Cincinnati
Here we are...
In utopia"

Simple Plan,Crazy,Still Not Getting Any...,10/18/2005,"Tell me what's wrong with society
When everywhere I look, I see
Young girls dying to be on TV
They won't stop till they've reached their dreams
Diet pills, surgery
Photoshopped pictures in magazines
Telling them how they should be
It doesn't make sense to me

Is everybody going crazy?
Is anybody gonna save me?
Can anybody tell me what's going on?
Tell me what's going on?
If you open your eyes
You'll see that something is wrong

I guess things are not how they used to be
There's no more normal families
Parents act like enemies
Making kids feel like it's World War III
No one cares, no one's there
I guess we're all just too damn busy
And money's our first priority
It doesn't make sense to me

Is everybody going crazy?
Is anybody gonna save me?
Can anybody tell me what's going on?
Tell me what's going on?

You'll see that something is wrong

Tell me what's wrong with society
When everywhere I look I see
Rich guys driving big SUVs
While kids are starving in the streets
No one cares
No one likes to share
I guess life's unfair

Is anybody gonna save me?
Can anybody tell me what's going on?

How much honesty's healthy
Say what's on your mind
The only way to be
The drugs are only for dessert
Do your homework first
We don't administer the cure for that thirst
'Cause it's always been heartbreaking music
So close to death we use it
Killing
Writing this over and over
It will never mend
I am the jest malignant cell
Playwright to your hell

I could I have changed your mind
Would of, should of, the question 'til I die

Stop, turn, take a look around
At all the lights and sounds
Let them bring you in
Slow burn, let it all fade out
Pull the curtain down
And wonder where you've been
Make it new but stay in the lines
Just let go but keep it inside
Smile big for everyone
Even when you know what they've done
They gave you the end but not where to start
Not how to build, how to tear it apart
So tell it all and fill up the air
But make it loud cause nobody's there

And I can feel the fire of the city lights burn
And it's hard to find angels in hell

Flying along, and I
Feel like I don't belong, and I
Can't tell right from the wrong, and why
Have I been here so long
In a city of devils we live
A city of devils we live
Questions I can't seem to find
To the answers I already have
And you can't see the sky here at night
So I guess I can't make my way back

What if I wanted you here right now?
Would you fall in the fire burn me down?

They tell us about when we're young
Rescuers working to clean up the crashes
Before she can see what they've done
Nobody told her she'd lose in the first round
The last fight was fixed from the start
Names on her sidewalks, they move through her body
Like razors they cut through her heart
Like razors they cut through her heart

Hey, let go of all you know
And you're flying away now
What have you got to lose?
And say out loud these words I've found
I'll be there when you come down
I'll be waiting for you

So someone remembers her, too
But somewhere she heard there was some place to go
When you die, when you live like we do
Die when you live like we do

My friend the giant and traveling sails
Tell you all the times that I failed
The years all behind me, the stories exhaled

And I'm drying out, crying out
This isn't how I go

I could tell you of a man not so tall
Who said life's a circus, and so we are small
Tell you of a girl that I saw
I froze in the moment and she changed it all

And I'm drying out, crying out
This isn't how I go
Hurry now, lay me down
And let these waters flow, flow

Son, I am not everything you thought that I would be
But every story I have told is part of me
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

And you keep the air in my lungs
Floating along as a melody comes
And my heart beats like timpani drums
Keeping the time while a symphony strums

And I'm drying out, crying out
This isn't how I go
Hurry now, lay me down
And let these waters flow
Flow, flow
Let it flow (Let it flow)

Yellowcard,Two Weeks from Twenty,Lights and Sounds,01/24/2006,"Jimmy wasn't really popular, he had a couple of friends back home
And sooner or later they're all getting out so he had to join up alone
He was dreaming of the Ivy league since he was only three feet tall
And get the hell out of Jersey and then he would never look back at all
And then your hear 'em say
That miles away
We lost another one that we sent with a gun
They're gonna miss him, he was two weeks from twenty
And there's still no shame
From the man to blame
Jimmy never had a reason to stay 'cause all the factories shut down
All he had was a line for his name so he could sign away his right to be proud
He tried to kiss her on the way out the door, but she just put her little hand on his face
'I don't understand why you're leaving', she said, 'but I hope you're gonna ask me to wait'
And then your hear 'em say
That miles away
We lost another one that we sent with a gun
His lady missed him, he was two weeks from twenty
And there's still no shame
From the man to blame
Jimmy's mother went to Capitol Hill so she could fill her heart up with joy
Maybe shake a few hands while she's there, and tell him 'thank you, sir, for taking my boy'

His mama missed him, he was two weeks from twenty

Why did I say all those things before I was sure?

(She is the one)
And I have to fight this
(She is the one)
The villain I can't knock down

I see your face with every punch I take
And every bone I break, it's all for you
And my worst pains are words I cannot say
Still I will always fight on for you
Mary's alive in the bright New York sky
The city lights shine for her, above them I cry for her
Everything's small on the ground below, down below
What if I fall, then where would I go, would she know?

Crashing inside you like motorbikes
We toss and turn, sleep so loud
Grind the teeth in our empty mouths
Our empty...
There's a forest fire burning bright
Spreading quickly towards our last rites
Nowhere to run, pointless to hide
Just lay there and scream, pretending to try
Pretending...
Intending to burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and you burn
This impending doom is left deep inside
And it's haunting you each and every night
Like starving wolves counting sheep
We close our eyes, pretending to sleep
Descending...
Intending to burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn, you live and
Like hell, we are anxiously waiting
Like hell, burning silently strong
Somehow we fell down by the wayside
And somehow this hell is home
As we burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and...
Like hell, we are anxiously waiting
Like hell, burning silently strong
Somehow we fell down by the wayside
And somehow this hell is home
Right now, this hell is my home"

You're wrong about drug use, when its not abuse

A victim of Cointelpro

Are already pushing prams
I loved you then as I love you still
Tho I put you on a pedestal
They put you on the pill
I dont feel bad about letting you go
I just feel sad about
Letting you know
I dont want to change the world
Im not looking for a new england
Im just looking for another girl
I dont want to change the world
Im not looking for a new england
Im just looking for another girl
I loved the words you wrote to me
But that was fucking yesterday
I can't survive on what you send
Every time you needing a friend
I saw two shooting stars last night
I wished on them but they were only satellites
Is it wrong to wish on space hardware
I wish, I wish, I wish youd care

The stars that pierce the sky

Oh, how they all adored him
Beauty will last when spiraled down
The stars that mystify
He left them all behind
And how his children cried
He left us all behind

Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?

What's the hook, the twist
Within this verbose mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light
Will fizzle out without hope
We're the empty set just floating through, wrapped in skin
Ever searching for what we were promised
Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

Cut off my legs when you tell me to walk
Slit my own throat when you say to talk

See myself in shredded skin
Sew my lips together
So I won't have to say a word
What I never meant to say
I wish I could erase it
Make it right again some day

And drown in the blood as it fills my lungs

Just a few moments to live, no remorse for what I did
It was for the betterment of man, I made the utmost sacrifice
Before more damage could be done I took his life
There was a split second of silence when the dart punctured the skin
Beady eyes rolled back in head, the body dropped from the poison
They could incapacitate me but could not erase my sneer
I heard a thousand people screaming while three billion others cheered
He was gone and I would soon be...
Executed by the state, all appeals would be in vain
I was not criminally insane, in fact I was found to be
An otherwise caring and respectable member of society
A minor threat except for that one man I killed
As the sedatives take effect, I just smile and close my eyes
There's a priest kneeling next to me, he asks me if I realize
I was going straight to hell and he thought that I should know
That the man I killed's replacement planned this whole scenario

I left the hybrid at home
I scored an extremely rare
Signed copy of The Communist Manifesto
We protested the G8
Got maced by female police

You're better, you're better
Your designer drug
Won't work, won't work for me
Connect to a three volt
I hope your battery dies
How could you run
On such, on such voltage?

All the same, I remain
The one to blame
And I'm demonized, purified
Justified, as you let yourself show

So now, you'll love these screams, what's left of me
(Don't speak)
Love these screams, like I do
(My name)

As the infinite stops cold
Just nine and the six are gone
Guess I was the one to
Ride that, ride that dirty ride
That is turning too fast now
I c-c-cannot, cannot hold on
But at this pace
Who would, who would want to?

All the same, I remain
The one to blame
And I'm demonized, purified
Justified, as you let yourself show

Press your lips to the sculptures
And surely, you'll stay (love like winter)
For of sugar and ice
I am made, I am made

It's in the blood)
I met my love before I was born
(He wanted love
I taste of blood)
He bit my lip, and drank my war
From years before, from years before

She exhales vanilla lace
I barely dreamt her, yesterday (yesterday)
Read the lines in the mirror through the lipstick trace
(Por siempre)
She said, ""It seems you're somewhere far away,"" to his face

Am I beautiful?
Am I usable?

Put on your face and let's pretend
These killing lights won't kill us all again

Three A.M. on the city street
When the air is sweet, I've had my mouth full
But it seems that outside the screen
Such a pretty face often will look dreadful

Am I beautiful?
Am I usable?

They never forget a face

The Bouncing Souls,For All The Unheard,The Gold Record,06/06/2006,"A guitar collects dust like his heart, soundless and still
A girl collapses on her bed, writing words never read
Troubled youth spills over into troubled life and times
We walk along with our troubled minds
A guitar strikes a chord, hits a misery so hard, so bold
Sounding through this world where it's so hard to feel that gold
It's running through a song of beauty buried deep under a river of greed
Where the muddy waters flow and the stones don't roll
This is for all the unheard, all the music left behind
All the songs left on the floor in the closets of our minds
Where's the passion gone in our hearts, lost somewhere in the grind?
It's time to bring it back, it's time to unwind, find what we lost, it's time
It's time to bring it back
A lost song lingers on
Bouncing off stars on and on
A moment gone, or is it looking for you
To sing its tune?
Troubled youth spills over into troubled life and times
We walk alone with our troubled minds
This is for all the unheard, all the music left behind
All the songs left on the floor in the closets of our minds

The Bouncing Souls,Letter From Iraq,The Gold Record,06/06/2006,"Hot Sunni sun passes moaning mosque spire
B-company's pinned down under heavy fire
Underneath the palms there's improvised bombs
Because Jihad Johnny knows Yankee is a liar
An eye for an eye and blood for Texas tea
At the call to prayer al-Qaeda's on its knees
Isaac versus Ishmael, Allah versus Christ
Zarqawi's on the offense picking up the beat
There's celebratory fire and a purple thumb vote
Tom Cruise is on the saudi from the Gulf love boat
Smart bombs are coming, see the children running
The dead, they are all laughing, but we don't get the joke
An eye for an eye and blood for Texas tea
At the call to prayer al-Qaeda's on its knees
Isaac versus Ishmael, Allah versus Christ
Zarqawi's on the offense picking up the beat
They lost another friend today
It's getting rough over there, they say the whole thing's fucked
I wish the boys were back, at least I know they're still alive
Another letter from Iraq
Presents full of Christmas loot
All that's left of Bullet Billy is a pair of bloody boots
His mom is on the phone, his girl is all alone
We all stand in the rain for a twenty-one gun salute"

Those ties that were so sweet also burned under his feet

And he can't turn back
He can't turn back
He can't turn back
Running through the crowds
He made it out alive
Betting everything on himself tonight
She's driving down the shore on a Jersey afternoon
She's driving down the same old road her parents took her through
Hypnotized by those broken lines, broken records lost in time
She's turning down a road that is new
And she can't turn back
No, she can't turn back
She can't turn back
Stepping through the darkness
Into the light
Betting everything on herself tonight
Stepping out of the Asbury Lanes in the midnight snow
The skeleton of this old town feels like it's coming alive
Riots and corruption, beaches and Bruce
These songs were the keys to the engines of our growing up
And we wanna say thanks to the music in our lives
Forgive ourselves for all the lies
Send some love to all the lonely
Don't forget we're all one family
Thanks to the music in our lives
For helping us to survive
Lost in one lonely dream
Born to run and live free
The sun shines brightly on us this afternoon
Walking in our own footsteps, a search for something new
And we can't turn back
No, we can't turn back
We can't turn back
Stepping through the darkness
Into the light
We're betting everything, we're betting everything
We're betting everything on ourselves tonight"

On lonely mornings like this
This emptiness inside, loneliness I feel
In this pain I'm not alone, in this city that is my home
One lonely heart reaching out to you
One strength to see us through
Alone together, this one goes out to you
We are not alone in this city that is our home"

Pizza's cooking in a storefront oven
On the corner a boy is waiting
The moonlight feels cold and desperate
Some hidden sadness is bound down
Attention lives all over town
Ready to burst open into driving
Burning, exploding sound
If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming all along
Tony's making slice pies for the lunch rush
Stirring the sauce, pounding out the dough
His brother left town with his girl
She ain't his girl no more
And some days, they seem to never end
So mundane in this old town
Ready to burst open into driving
Burning, exploding sound
If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming all along
May all these walls we've made
In our wasted years and days
Not stand in our way
That we may feel the winds of change
If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming all along
If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming, coming, coming, coming, coming all along"

My heart skipped a beat today
Reminding me of those lost days and glory never fades
Never fades, fades away
After years and miles, my broken feet
Walk back to you up this broken street
I guess the years went by, but the years just made you shine
And never fade, fade away
I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold
I saw you from across the street today
My heart skipped a beat today
Reminding me of those lost days
And glory never fades
Years passed by and you remind me
Those things will always find me
Young hearts are made of gold that never fades away
Never fades, fades away
I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold
As the years pass by
A young heart beats inside
These dreams of yours and mine that time can't take away
Take away, take away

That nothing gold can stay

And mark a place in time for every chance you took?

I've yet to take the hint, someday
I'm sure I'll get the picture
And stop waiting up

When it all comes down
To a sunrise on the East Side
Will you be there to carry home
The remains of my wasted youth?
This wasted time on you
Has left me shaking in waiting
Shaking in waiting for something more

Tonight is alive with the promise of a street-fight
And there's money on the table
That says your cheap shots won't be able to break bones
I've yet to break a sweat
I'll make your past regret its future
Here's to you

To a sunrise on the East Side

We'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like
Make all of my decisions for me
I've never taken the fall for deceit
We'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like this

I can keep a secret if you can keep me guessing
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me pressing
For more than just a moment of truth between the lies told
To pull ourselves away from the lives we leave back
(I can keep a secret if you can keep me guessing)
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me here, keep me here

Jasey (Say you'll mean it)
You're dressed to kill, I'm calling you out

A stabbing pain that says I lack
The common sense and confidence
To bring an end to promises
That I make in times of desperate conversation
Hoping my night could be better than theirs in the end
Just say when

Don't make this easy
I want you to mean it
Jasey (Say you'll mean it)
You're dressed to kill, I'm calling you out
(Don't waste your time on me)

I've never told a lie and that makes me a liar
I've never made a bet but we gamble with desire
I've never lit a match with intent to start a fire
But recently the flames are getting out of control
Call me a name, kill me with words
Forget about me, it's what I deserve
I was your chance to get out of this town
But I ditched the car and left you to-
Wait outside, I hope the air will serve to remind you
That my heart is as cold as the clouds of your breath
And my words are as timed as the beating in my chest"

Scream to be heard, like you needed any more attention;
Throw the bottle, break the door and disappear

Sing me to sleep, I'll see you in my dreams
Waiting to say, ""I miss you. I'm so sorry.""

Forever's never seemed so long as when you're not around
It's like a piece of me is missing
I could have learned so much from you, but what's left now?
Don't you realize you showed this family a world of pain?
Can't you see this should have been a happy ending we let go?

Sing me to sleep, I'll see you in my dreams
Waiting to say, ""I miss you. I'm so sorry.""

Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep

Even in the summer
She was wrapped in a blanket by the pool

I couldn't bare to touch
I couldn't bare it

It's not your fault so please stop your crying now
Please stop your crying now

There was staring and seclusion
A fine tuned way of motion
A face wrapped for a suitor
The sound of hearts pumping at the same beat
Coming 'round the corner
In almost all directions
A sense of heat that
I couldn't bare to touch
No, I couldn't bare it

Just because I could
You're so close but you're so very, very, very far away
Tonight we dance, tomorrow we'll talk
Maybe on Thursday we'll fall in love

Where there once was a connection
There is an absence of any feeling
The words to me mean nothing now
Nor will they ever again
They speak of losing someone as if it's final
As I drift closer to the end
There are no songs
For the man of infirmity
Well the arrow through the heart
And the needle through the vein
Can't be bothered with any heartache
It's got nothing on this pain
Now I don't want some extravagant production
No nostalgia at my age
All I want is someone who knows my shame
Who can play me off the stage
There are no songs
For the man of infirmity"
The Ergs,Radio K,Jersey's Best Prancers,01/01/2007,"Well it's getting kind of cold
So I'll take the skyway home
I don't want to be alone
But you've given me no choice
I bet they had a great big laugh back home
When you told them what I've done
Oh I thought you were the one
Talk about the biggest lie
St. Paul is cynical
As I rattle off my problems
To no one listening
And I'm listening to Radio K
Drown my sorrows in the frequency
And I'm listening to Radio K
As she drives away"
The Ergs,Short Stories,Jersey's Best Prancers,01/01/2007,"Oh Eveline
I'm so tired of saying the wrong thing
While amped up on caffeine
Sweaty hand-soaked paper notes
Freeform acts and deleted scenes
""I think you're beautiful,"" I said
Then the next week you were gone
You moved out to another town
You're the main character
In my short stories
There are no happy ends
Oh Eveline
I'm so tired of saying the wrong thing
While amped up on caffeine
A furiously scribbled out manuscript
New revisions of fucked up dreams
""You said, 'You think I'm cool',"" she said
How do I interpret that?
What the hell does that mean?
Oh Eveline
I'm so tired of saying the wrong thing
While amped up on caffeine
Oh Eveline"
The Ergs,Bike Shoppe,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Went to the city, we played stickball
One hundred degrees and a fog of mosquitoes
And to think that I feel old here
Don't call me sir, I'm just a boy
The sounds of a skateboard on a sidewalk
Ice cream and candy and a soda
I'm just glad there are no cops here
Just you, me and the world
The earth won't stop for me
How long is the summer and how many are there?
If there's another, let's do something impulsive
Six weeks on a roadtrip
Or a lifetime of regret
The earth won't stop for me"
The Ergs,Books About Miles Davis,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"I'm thinking of a girl
She came around here a couple years before
I'm much older now
And it would be wonderful
If I could re-write history
All of these could've beens
I guess they're left to mystery
And you could say I'm falling in love
And you probably will
I'm thinking a lot more
I'm freaking out and you've heard it all before
I apologize
And I'm having these restless nights
And I swear it's growing tired
You say ""it's all good"" and ""I'm preaching to the choir""
And you could say I'm ""a little insane""
And you probably will
This is all I've got
I'll quit my job and I'll sell this vacant lot that is my life
And I'll settle down in a place I've only read about in books about Miles Davis
I'll bust right through that door and say
I'm here to save us and then
You could say I should probably go
And you probably will"
The Ergs,"Boston, Massachusetts",Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Heard a song
From the album ""Boston, Mass.""
By the Del Fuegos the other day
It sounded good
I remembered how you used to like them
So I wrote this letter but I didn't send it out
Did you ever get married?
I don't think I wanna know
'Cause this torch that I carry
Is burnin' up my soul
When I heard them sing the verses
Of ""Hand In Hand"" and ""I Still Want You""
In that record store in Brooklyn
It made me think about that summer and you
And you and the album ""Boston, Mass.""
By the Del Fuegos the other day"
The Ergs,Girls of the Market Square,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Steel pyramids bear the load
Of a secret girl that I just saw
Her naive eyes dart forward
The red lights read segmented black
She's always changing her mind
She's giving advice or giving out signs
The cigarette smoke is rising and
The coffee rolls off her lips
Oh, girls of market square
Can't help but hide my eyes
Apathetic look in her eyes
I'd like to see what she has seen
A stick figure in a painting of
Fat ladies barking this and that
She's reading my favorite book
And funny, last night I dreamt of her
We were at some religious function
Who knew her and I shared a god?"
The Ergs,Hysterical Fiction,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Guess I should change the sheets
Now that the word is you're never coming back
I've heard there's a chemical
In the skin that keeps one attached
Howling wolves turn into losers
Battered wives return to abusers
Lying in the corner, broken intravenous users
I'm gonna take your pillowcase down to the lab
I'm gonna precipitate what's left of what we had
And you can smoke it
You can smoke it
Now I got a business model
To make all this bullshit obsolete
Co-dependence powder for sale
Down at your pharmacy
They say the best revenge is to live well
If I can be a millionaire, then hell
I won't have to break the rule
On taking what you're selling
Don't wait for the nice Serling twist
Put everything back like it is
Not gonna burn it all down to the ground"
The Ergs,It'll Be O.K.,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"I've got a loveseat with a front beam cracked and broken
I've got some things to say to you that are better left unspoken
Maybe we could lean together, try to share some warmth
Can't go back to what it was or say that we weren't warned
I've got a handful of the
Day's hours left to go before
I fall dead asleep and
Then head off to work once more
Maybe we could lie together staring straight ahead
Lines of vision parallel, they'll never intersect
At the end of the night and the inevitable flight
Where we both finally realize we can't get this right
Even if it crumbles by the breaking light of day
It'll be ok
I've got a little bit of time to try to sort it out
When it's stolen by a random nothing it only fuels the doubt
That we're holding things together
By the trite-est of cliches"
The Ergs,See Him Again,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"You and I
Could never see eye to eye
Cause you were always making his day
And you're always making me wait
I can see
The smiles that you gave to me
And taken back and meant for someone else
I don't know
But I guess it's slightly better than being alone
Getting half your saccharine kisses to call my own
When you say, ""I'll never leave, rest assured""
It's the greatest lie I've ever heard
And I believe every word
I can see
The smiles that you gave me
Are faded and non-existent now
And so am I
And anyway it's gonna work out right for you
If you leave cause he's a better man for you
But if you stay there's something I must ask of you
If you see him again
Tell him you never wanna see him again
I know I'm being selfish
But I can't deal with this"
The Ergs,Stinking of Whiskey Blues,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"I've heard it said it takes twice the length
Of an affair for the heart to heal
And if that's the case then I guess in 20 years
I'll be sitting on this barstool still
Cause you were the one
I felt that I was lucky just to have you by my side
Now it's 10 years gone and I'm sitting all alone
Drinking and stuff
Bar time is 6:30
And you're still on my mind
By 8:15 I already have a couple in me
And I've already forgotten you were even mine
By 9:43 I'll be regretting my decisions
And cursing this city of sin
By 10:15 I'll be stinking of whiskey
And thinking of you again
I've heard it said by many of my friends
You were a girl I should leave alone
They said all you're gonna do is check
Into your room only to find a Gideon's Bible
Now all I got are those and 15 ""I told you so's""
So I guess I'm the one to blame
Sitting on a stool feeling like a broken fool
A tarnished drunkard with a tarnished name"
The Ergs,"The Clocks, The Clocks",Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Hello Katelyn, let's start another
Bullshit day among the rest
Grab your coffee and a smile
And we'll blow through this f*cking mess
Maybe I could make a stupid joke
Maybe you could have another smoke
And we plot our f*cking way out of this town
I wake up early too
And I punch this clock the same as you
And I don't like it anymore than you do
Take comfort in the fact you're not alone"
The Ergs,Things I Could Never Find a Way to Say,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Ummm, so...
I was wondering if maybe
You could do something next Friday
Cause I think your band is pretty great
And your hair looks really cute that way
And I know this might seem sudden and crazy
But these are the things I could never find a way to say
And if you'd be my girl
It would be so cool
If you'd if my girl
It'd be so indie rock
It's a shame"
The Ergs,Trouble in River City,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"I guess you didn't notice but I get this all the time
I know what you're doing here
You've come here fighting loneliness
And you wish you were mine
Well save your Harvey Danger references, I'm spoken for
I don't mean to bring you down
But there'll be trouble in River City if you're around
You need to make a getaway
And I'm parked right outside
I need you to get out of here
You look less than sober but I'm ok to drive
I need to get you out of here"

I know I'm stupid
I know you're ok
I know I blew it
I know you don't think much of me
I couldn't blame you cause I'm the one who broke your heart
I know that its pretty fucking pointless
Trying to make some peace cause you're happy leaving me behind
I know that if you saw me on the street
You would walk right past
You wouldn't even see that we used to be this close
We used to be like best friends
Now you don't care anymore
Now you can't believe what I did
To you

The Ergs,Your Cheated Heart,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Your cheated heart is getting rusty
Your cheated heart has never been so broken
Your cheated heart is through with trusting
Your cheated heart is nothing new
A blank expression on a fuzzy screen
Tells me things couldn't get much worse
You say you're giving up on love
He ruined it for everyone
I wish I'd gotten there first
'Cause then you'd be feeling like a queen
And I'd be holding the girl of my dreams
I could help you mend your cheated heart"
Good Charlotte,The River,Good Morning Revival,01/04/2007,"As I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of L.A
The footsteps that were next to me
Have gone their separate ways
I've seen enough now to know that beautiful things
Don't always stay that way
I've done enough now to know this beautiful place
Isn't everything they say

I heard that evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels
I'm walking towards the light

Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life and I want to be delivered
In the city was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong but I swear I'm a believer
Like the prodigal son, I was out on my own
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I'm delivered, I'm delivered

You're from a small town, you're going to grow up fast
Underneath these lights
Down in Hollywood, on the boulevard
The dead come back to life
To the praying Mother and the worried Father
Let your children go
If they come back they'll come home stronger
And if they don't you'll know

They say that evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels
I'm walking towards the light

Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life and I want to be delivered
In the city was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong but I swear I'm a believer
Like the prodigal son, I was out on my own
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I'm delivered, I'm delivered

Baptized in the river (On my own)
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
On my own
On my own
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
I confess I'm a sinner
I've seen a vision of my life and I want to be delivered"

A Day to Remember,Monument,For Those Who Have Heart,01/22/2007,"It's Monday morning
And I would kill for a chance to drive
Get so far away from here with you my dear
That I'll never leave your side
Nobody knows the troubles I've seen
In a van, on a soapbox for the world to see

Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them

We're getting older
I've started to fear for my life
Is this the way that it should be?
This whole thing's riding on me
It's been a long road so far
With nowhere to turn
There's no looking back from here
No more dwelling on my fears

Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me

Come on

Here's a middle finger
Coming straight from OCA-L-A
I appreciate your judgement
It's proved that I can't trust a word you say
Those must be some pair of binoculars
That you see every move I make
So I'll never be a liar
But you'll always be two-faced

You'll get what's coming to you
You're blinded by your instincts
I'm not your fucking game
I'm not so easily beat

I'm looking down at this mess that you've made
And I can't believe that I stayed
So unhappy for so long
Where did I go wrong?
I've got to get out of this
My hand is on the handle
We're leaving everything behind
Goodbye for a lifetime

I'll rip that scandalous bitch in two
We'll bring the noise

Try to pretend that I never even knew your name
Cause everything you are disgusts me
(Too bad I can't turn back time)
So I wouldn't be here
What I'd give for you to disappear
So tell me girly how's your edge?

You've got nothing better to do
I know why you can't see straight
I thought you were better than this
But you're just like everyone else

I'm looking down at this mess that you've made
And I can't believe that I stayed
So unhappy for so long
Where did I go wrong?

Not too far from here
Out on the East Coast
Maybe it resides in you my dear
We're worn out on our courtesy
We've made our curtain calls
Like vampire bats deprived of blood
Into the New York City night we crawl
And you've got a funny way of showing off
Your bathroom surgery
You said you were just cooling down
From plans of leaving me
There's something I should tell you
For we may not have much time
I've never met arms like yours
The stars at night are big and bright
Deep in your eyes, Miss Vincent
You told me once I made you smile
We both know damn well I didn't
I'm not much of a jester
But I'd test poison food for you
Your majesty, you're royal blue
I'm loyalty, my king of pain
There's a hard rain falling
Flooding your attic, it's clear
Can't put out the fire
That resides in you, my dear
There's something I should tell you
For we may not have much time
I've never seen scars like yours

Always darker, emptier, and simpler

I just thank them for showing up at all
I have black periods. Who does not?
But they are not a part of me;
They are not a part of illness, but a part of my being
What am I saying?
I have the courage to have them
Four o' clock in the morning. This sucks.""

I can't go on
You set my head too heavy
I need that song
Those trusty chords could pull me through
And early on
They saw the warning signs and symptoms all day long
We'd sit and dream of better days

When we'd hit the ground running on empty
Stories we've been told
And all those nights we spent together
Never felt this fucking cold
When we let the car run in the driveway
Kiss you one last time
Before we brought the horses in before
The storm of '59, of '59

I can't go on
These limbs have grown too heavy
I need that song
A night on earth could pull me through
And early on
They saw the warning signs and symptoms all day long
Wonder how far from here we'll fall

Before we hit the ground running on empty
Stories we've been told
And those nights we spent together
Never felt this fucking cold
When we let the car run in the driveway
Kiss you one last time
Before we brought the horses in before

True blue
But the prince of any failing empire knows that
Everybody wants, everybody wants
To drive on through the night
If it's a drive back home

Things aren't the same anymore
Some nights, they get so bad
You almost pick up the phone

Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
You know, it's strange
It's a strange way of saying
That I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you

I've already given up on myself twice
Third time is the charm, third time is the charm
Threw caution to the wind
But I've got a lousy arm
And I've traced your shadows on the wall
Now I kiss them whenever I'm down
Whenever I'm down
Figured on not figuring myself out

Things aren't the same anymore
Some nights, they get so bad
I almost pick up the phone

Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
You know, it's strange
It's a strange way of saying
That I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you

Born under a bad sign, you saved my life
That night on the roof of your hotel
""Cross my heart and hope to die
Splintered from the headboard in my eye""
Photo-proofed kisses I remembered so well

Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns

Better off against worse for wear
And you're someone who knows someone
Who knows someone I once knew
And I just want to be a part of this
The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Hired a construction crew 'cause it's hell on the engine
And you are the dreamer and we are the dream
I could write it better than you ever felt it

So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

My words are my faith, to hell with our good name
A remix of your guts, your insides x-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
I love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
I could write it better than you ever felt it

So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu

A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part

Last summer we took threes across the board
But by fall, we were a cover story, ""Now in stores""
Make us poster boys for your scene
But we are not making an acceptance speech
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes
Every dot com's refreshing for a journal update

So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five

I can take your problems away with a nod and a wave...
Of my hand, 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am
The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the diehards

So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life

They don't take a step
Line keeps on pushing

Was gone and it was raining

Now Saturday is cold and damp and
I left you all alone, I didn't talk at all

The way that I got no more to say
And the rest of you can say its right
But I don't trust a thing in sight
When everything is overrated
You're so good you just can't fake it
I waited for some kind of answer
Some kind words so that I can cold ya
I left you all alone
I didn't talk at all and now I feel so sad
I guess I just needed a day to feel lonely
Lonely and blue
Oh, how about you?
Well it was raining all day long
Well it was raining all day long
Well it was raining all day long
Well it was raining all day long
Punk Rock Millionaires with coke up their nose
Writing records in designer homes
But the rains kinda nice
And it's really all right if we don't talk at all
It's only one song!"

And i'm in trouble deep
Yeah i'm so tired
Not enough cash to keep me in vices
I can't think about it now
She's getting too close and i don't even like it
I can't think about it now
Always behind on the latest devices
I can't think about it now
Panic in the office
Record label crisis
I can't think about it now
So many words i like like to say to convince you i'll stay
So many words i'd like to say to convince you that i'm so tired
So many words that i'd love to get by this
But everyone's watching me
I'm out of disguises
And nobody know if the kids gonna like it
So c'mon and tell me
Don't think about all the things that you want
And the things that you need
Its only a matter of what you don't see
There's not enough cash
And there ain't enough vices
Couldn't think about it even if i tried to"

She's all books and quotations
And no fun and games

Don't you believe it
Don't you believe it
When its quiet and lights are low
You're the last one you want around
You're the last one to know
Cuz its over you know when I said
Its time to go now don't let things go to your head
Its over won't you come over

Lifetime,Just A Quiet Evening,Lifetime,02/06/2007,"Living at home
Living under one roof
Walls are raging
They're all crazy
Mind is racing
Say you left it far behind
And you'll always feel your 17
In a dream
Isn't it a sad thing that we all can't win?
You got your sad songs or the radio
It's for sure that you are all done
Just a quiet evening
Just a quiet evening
When you get home the street is quiet in the morning
And the sight of her is all you need to get so down
I can't figure how a letter so upset her just climb down the stairs
Just disappear
I can promise something fleeting
Just a quiet evening that will pass
And although we ain't got nothing to show
By sitting at home
It'd mean a lot to me
I can promise something fleeting
Just a quiet evening that will pass
Just a quiet evening
Just a quiet evening"

Almost time for us to go so won't you open up your door

I hope your in your car right now turning this shit up so loud
I hope your in the mood to tune into my favorite station
Across the nation it's a fact you ain't never coming back
Car is running out of gas push it up the overpass
You stayed inside to long so come along just come on you stayed away
Too long so i wrote for you this song

I never thought you'd only want me
I know he didn't want her
She didn't want him to
Stay around forever

And now your gone away for good
You fall in love but love has gone away
And now your gone away for good
You fall in love but love has gone
It's a funny little thing
And it gets inside your head
It's a killer round the corner
And all you really do is try and keep your cool
And wait till everything blows over
Leave it alone, leave it alone
Don't take your love away so soon
We could just play records at night
I know its been a long time"
Lifetime,Song For Mel,Lifetime,02/06/2007,"Oh it was so nice this towns a paradise
Sidewalks burning and so your locked inside your room
It's just a calm before the changing tide
It was so simple now theres things to sign
And someones always waiting round
With matches by their side
And someones sneaking in the office getting high
Oh Oh it's a common action
It's a perfect scene
Lets write about it in a magazine
Everyones so excited it's the next big thing
Just the latest chapter
It's a total dram"
Lifetime,Spiders In A Garden,Lifetime,02/06/2007,"You're standing on the street
You've thought of everything
I don't think it's overrated
I just wondered what the date was
You're standing on the street
New sneakers, everything
But no one broke the news
You wonder why you spend the night
Cars drive on by
It's the same old story
Please tell me I'm dreaming
I'll believe it when I see it
I do it for the right reasons, you'd have to agree
I just think you're too polite
You're wound so tight
You fuss and fight
Please tell me I gotta be wrong
But my heart is pounding too strong
You left so I went home
Go check your answers and get off the phone now
But you change direction
The garden's protection
And the moons just right
Take a look at the trees
Tell me what do you see
It's all for us
Don't get lost darling
Maybe it's something
Maybe it's not
We'll see, maybe
But it's all we got"

All night but I'm too tired and your uptite
I'm getting into something good
Like I knew I would
And the time it takes to bust that party
We can waste another night
Just sitting on the porch all night until the wine is through

You're lost so, so lonely
You'll never make it you phoney
The reason you told me
You'll never make it you phoney
Can i turn off your MODERN ROCK
Just hit the button make it stop
You're getting into something good, like i knew you would
You're calling on a static line
When all you want to feel is fine
And she's another reason why your always acting good

There's a reason why you feel so low and it's starting to show
Could you reach for the door I don't wanna stay here no more
I don't know how you missed it before
There's a reason you came here I'm sure
But you don't really know get your pants off the floor and go home
And go home
Just stay awake
But just don't let it get in your head
Don't let it get in your head"
Lifetime,Yeems Song For Nothing,Lifetime,02/06/2007,"So cool it down
Relax a while
You get too crazy
Quit holding out
On the couch
Your glass is nearly empty
But did you see it all come down
Along your race to ruin
No reason to talk now
No reason to talk
Quit making lists of all the stuff that you did
Just push on lightly and don't think about the stuff you hid
Your love has gone for good
Though he's still in the room
No more talk of future
I can't bare to lose you
At all the shows
Love comes and goes
And then you wonder, are we over exposed?
Don't wanna know
Your favorite show
All I wanted to know is
What time I could stop by
She don't know
She never knows
I saw it come down
When he blew into town
It was right on the corner
When you pulled her inside
They never know
They never know"
The Ataris,"Act V, Scene IV: And So It Ends Like It Begins",Welcome the Night,02/20/2007,"The smell of incense
It fills the air inside this room
Cast of light colorly strewn about the floor
A casket lined with pills
And the bitter taste of absinth
To wash it down
And so it ends like it began
At a cross
Along this interstate
A worn inscription
All cracked and faded
These actions will remain
When bodies turn to dust
And from this monument
I will drown inside the anguish of your heart
A new dawn broke this morning
Tears were raining in this room
As pure as holy water
Reflecting images of you
This world is like a whore
So ravish and so beautiful
So bitter cold and all alone
And if i had my way
We'd wake up on the day we met
I'd stare into your heart for hours
And try to make you hear the sweetest thoughts
But not tonight
We die inside each others arms
We'd revel in our last embrace
I'd steal the breath right from your heart
And kiss you as we die
I rest my lifeless head upon your heart
Forever
I rest my lifeless head upon your heart
Forever
I rest my lifeless head upon your heart
Forever
Maybe i'll bring you sunlight after all
I'm sorry
Maybe i'll bring you sunlight after all
I'm sorry
Maybe i'll bring sunlight after all
I'm sorry
Maybe i'll be sunlight after all
So sorry
Maybe i'll greet sunlight after all
I'm sorry
Maybe i'll greet sunlight after all"
The Ataris,Cardiff-by-the-Sea,Welcome the Night,02/20/2007,"The sea has become
Profoundly red as wine
The skies they bleed with fleeting passion tonight
Come sweet euphoria
Your light is blinding to me
You feel as comforting as a mother's warm embrace
But still you're just as lonely as the sea
We gaze out upon the crashing waves
From this hillside graveyard masquerade
Sweet terrible angel
Embrace my soul with light
Is it honesty that sunk my lungs and is dying to get out
But still I'm helpless as an orphaned child
Can you cure this loneliness in my heart
My heart
Can you cure this loneliness in my heart
In my heart
Euphoria, euphoria
Euphoria, euphoria
Euphoria, euphoria"
The Ataris,New Years Day,Welcome the Night,02/20/2007,"You're a senior double major
You got such big ideas
We were searching for a savior
To guide us through those restless years
If only I could steal you away
From those paths we were led astray
I would take back all those things I said
That new year's day
If only I could make you see
That all those dreams belonged to me
I'd take back all those things I said
That new year's day
The October autumn twilight
The chilling of our breath
I had dreams I've found redemption
And a past full of regret
And the clouds on the horizon
Look like a thousand paper cranes
And I heard your voice
But couldn't scream your name
If only I could steal you away
From those paths were led astray
I would take back all those things I said
That new year's day
If only I could make you see
That all those dreams belonged to me
I'd take back all those things I said
That new year's day
So let's drink to forgiveness
Let's drink for regret
Let's drink to the ones we've loved and lost
Let us never forget
The mannequin shields her glowing eyes
We'll all too human, yeah
We're always searching on
Until that gift of isolation has been won
If only I could steal you away
From those paths were led astray
I would take back all those things I said
That new year's day
If only I could make you see
That all those dreams belonged to me
I'm haunting them the way you know you're haunting me
If only I could steal you away
From those paths were led astray
I would take back all those things I said
That new year's day
That new year's day"
The Ataris,Not Capable of Love,Welcome the Night,02/20/2007,"Beneath the glow of this hanging moon
Lies a city still and cold
Our silhouettes walk hand in hand
The drunken jukebox serenade
We pretend we're so innocent
Cause no one ever likes to hurt
Go take off that silver dress
And expose your naked heart
I'm not capable of love
That kind of love
That I felt when I was twenty one
Cause I'm not capable of love
That kind of love
That I felt when I was twenty one
Take it back
So happy birthday darling
Watch those candles melt away
Not unlike those chandeliers
At the bar where we both etched our names
Who would have thought we'd fall so hard
Who would have thought we'd fall so fast
Optimistic children
Clinging tight to all we never had
I'm not capable of love
That kind of love
That I felt when I was twenty one
Cause I'm not capable of love
That kind of love
Could I wish that I could take back
Take it back
You're the only one I want
I wish that I could take it back
Am I not capable of love
That kind of love
That I felt when I was twenty one
Cause I'd be right if I said
You're not my biggest regret
Could I wish that I could take it back
Cause I'm not capable of love
That kind of love
That I felt when I was twenty one
Take it back"
The Ataris,The Cheyenne Line,Welcome the Night,02/20/2007,"In silence, I like to think out loud
You say this is the end
I know it's not the end
I took a picture
Of heaven when we broke down
Across the Cheyenne Line
I never will forget
The color of last night
Over us
We missed the point in living
So caught up in this moment
We threw out all convictions
And traded them for substance
This life you hold so near
Will fade in time...
And so it goes
No we won't let go
If you are alive
Then be truly alive
Just open up your eyes
Pay attention to the signs
The color of the sky in this night
We missed the point in living
So caught up in this moment
We threw out all convictions
And traded them for substance
This life we hold so dear
Will fade in...
Time spend wasted on a lie
It's time you found some frame of mind
This life you hold so near
Will fade in time
We missed the point in living
So caught up in this moment
We threw out all convictions
And traded them for substance
This life we hold so dear
Will fade in time
And so it goes
No we won't let go
And so it goes
No no you won't let go
This life you hold so dear
Will fade in time..."
The Ataris,Welcome the Night,Welcome the Night,02/20/2007,"Can we understand life
And live it at the same time
Where is this purpose you speak of?
I'll be the background of this photograph
The soundtrack to this night
And we are fading out, before our eyes
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
In heaven so wonderful
Why are we oh so afraid of dying young
We are dying young
We are the patterns and the shapes
The patchwork from the window on this place
We are alone, alone, alone
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
This television set, it burns my eyes
And there is no one here
That can keep me warm tonight
Where is this purpose
Where is the lie, the lie, the lie
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
Close your eyes and welcome in the night"
Good Charlotte,Break Apart Her Heart,Good Morning Revival,03/27/2007,"When you call she doesn't answer
When you write she doesn't answer
You go out you see him with her
She told you she was sick at home
The ring you gave her
Thrown away with all the letters
And when you see him with her
He doesn't even care at all
And she follows him around like you follow her around
And he doesn't even care and you figure it out
The only way you're going to keep somebody around
Well I'm about to let you know

There's something I don't want to understand
The only way a woman's going to want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she's the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you've got to give
If you want to keep the girl for as long as you live
Just break it apart her heart

Can't you see the way she's crying
Well that's what keeps her trying
She knew that she could have you
And he don't give her what she wants
There's truth about this
You say you want to be noticed
Well if you want to be noticed
You got to learn to break some hearts
Don't try to understand

There's something I don't want to understand
The only way a woman's going to want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she's the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you've got to give
If you want to keep the girl for as long as you live
Just break it apart her heart

Can you see
What you've done
What I've become
What I've become
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
I don't understand this cruelty
I don't understand but now I see

There's something I don't want to understand
The only way a woman's going to want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she's the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you've got to give
If you want to keep the girl for as long as you live
Just break it apart her heart

I don't understand it's just not me

You carry Dior bags

You wear Louis Vuitton, HG, and YSL
Now I got Bathing Ape
I got DCMA
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain
I got a model 26
But she stays in her place
I got a Kershaw neatly
Tucked inside in my waist

And the record keeps playing
The same old song
The hipster mean mugging on me all night long
They say ""Ah ha, ah ha""
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl
They say ""Ah ha, ah ha""
But the record keeps playing
The same old song
They say ""Ah ha, ah ha""
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl

Now she sweating my friends
And my hurricane shoes
She likes the records I spin
My Adam Barton tattoos
But she can't say ""what's up""
So what does she do
She just stays posted up
The other side of the room
I got AMC tattooed on my hand
I got Black Wall Street on a black bandana

Me, me, I don't want to fight about it
I just want to be up out it
I'm just trying to stay up out it
Step out the wagon
You know the boy starts to hate
The girl that came with him
They like that's not the boy she dates
They get to fighting and swearing
And now the boyfriend is staring
The disco ball on the ceiling
Looks like the chain that I'm wearing
But the music keeps playing
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain

And the record keeps playing
The same old song

Sum 41,Underclass Hero,Underclass Hero,05/15/2007,"(One, two, three, four...)

Well, I won't be caught living in a dead-end job
While praying to my government, guns, and God
Now it's us against them, we're here to represent
And spit right in the face of the establishment

And now I don't believe (in having faith in nothing)
Stand on my own (and got no sympathy)
Wasting the youth (while being young and useless)
Speak for yourself (and don't pray for me)

Well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you
'Cause we'll be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold
Just like you

(A call across the Underclass)
Calling out loud with no respect
I'm not the one, I'm just another reject
I'm the voice to offend all those who pretend
Unsung against the grain, I'm here to rise against

Now I'm desensitized (I state my place in nowhere)
Burning the flag (of the degeneration)
Everyone sing (the anthem of no future)
Down with the mass ('cause we're not listening)

Well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you
'Cause we'll be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold
Just like you

May I have your attention please?
I pledge allegiance to the Underclass
As your hero at large!

(One, two, three, four...)
We're the saints of degeneration
We don't owe anyone an explanation

I do, I still think of you when we dance
Although we can't jitterbug as we did then

Do you remember when
How long has it been?
1945, you opened my blue eyes
To see a whole new life
Do you remember when
I told you this that night?
That if you're by my side
When every day begins
I'll fall for you again
I made a promise when
I told you this that night

I'll be fine
Cause when i die, then i die loving you
It's alright, i'll be fine
When i die then i die loving you
Loving you, loving you

Do you remember the times we would give up on each other then get back together
Then we finally was married in 1949
We drove the yellow convertible on our honeymoon
Do you remember? I do

Life has led us here
Together all these years
This house that we have made
Holds 20,000 days
The memories we've saved
Since life has led us here


I'm coming home to you
Slipping off my shoes
Resting in my chair
I see you standing there
The silver in your hair
I'm coming home to you
When i lay tonight
When i close my eyes
I know the sun will rise
Here or the next life
As long as you're still mine, then it's alright


You have grey hair now
But you are a beautiful woman
And the years have been good to both of us

I've become the victimized now, desensitized now

I pay for all the bad things I've done

(Where'd I go wrong?) Something's wrong because I
Find the glamour in the dark side, in the dark side
(Where'd I go wrong?) Cheap regrets, can't forget
Falling victim to the debts still, unpaid in my mind

The one and only day has come
I pay for all the bad things I've done

It's going to take me, you don't know tragedy
I've been to hell and back again to tell and
Close my eyes and lay me down to sleep
I fear the worst, my beating heart ticks to explode
And my time is up so
Why can't I just lie?
Living dead awake, the horror show begins
So pull the curtains over me

It's a free-for-all kill them all, every last one of them

Drown the thoughts that have me confined

Gutter dreams as black as the night

No one told me empathy's a lie

Suffocate the dreams in my mind
(I can't stop believing)

And paid your price, and sealed your fate within

I've been waiting for the chance to reunite this increment
Poison never hurt so good
So nice of you to speak of me, your closest friend and enemy
And only saviour of masochists

Well, it's the dead-end, slave
From the altar to the grave
It's the last days of our life and faith, amen

Time, it's been so long and now there's nothing to say
I'm trying so hard to find the words to say
I'm tired of being, now I'm something I'm not
I can't believe and I never thought

Days would come to an end
Well maybe someday we'll meet again
If ever that day never comes it would be too soon, my love

I've been waiting for the chance to nullify this increment
Pull the chord to detonate
So sick of you don't speak of me, no represent of misery

Satisfaction guaranteed a pill away catastrophe
On a mission, nowhere bound, inhibitions underground
A shallow grave I have dug all by myself

Started making his way past 2 in the morning
He hasn't been sober for days
Leaning now into the breeze
Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees
They had breakfast together
But two eggs don't last
Like the feeling of what he needs

Now this place seems familiar to him
She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
Left him dying to get in

Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

And even though she doesn't believe in love
He's determined to call her bluff
Who could deny these butterflies?
They're filling his gut
Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
He pleads, though he tries
But he's only denied
Now he's dying to get inside

Funny how it rained all day
I didn't think much of it then
But it's starting to all make sense
Oh, I can see now that all of these clouds
Are following me in my desperate endeavor
To find my whoever, wherever she may be

I'm not coming back (forgive me)
I've done something so terrible
I'm terrified to speak (I'm not calling, I'm not calling)
But you'd expect that from me
I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt, now the rain is just (You're driving me crazy, I'm)
Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
Keeping an eye on the world
From so many thousands of feet off the ground
I'm over you now, I'm at home in the clouds
And towering over your head

Well I guess I'll go home now
I guess I'll go home now
I guess I'll go home now

And that won't happen to me

Whoa
No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoa
And we won't come back, the world is calling out
Whoa
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company
Well, so long, you'll miss me when I'm gone

Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
When I'm gone
Let's go!

Won't look back
When I say goodbye
I'm gonna leave this hole behind me
Gonna take what's mine tonight
'Cause every wasted day becomes a wasted chance
You're gonna wake up feeling sorry
'Cause life won't wait
I guess it's up to you

Whoa
No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoa
And we won't come back, the world is calling out
Whoa
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company
Well, so long, you'll miss me when I'm gone

Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone"
Saves the Day,Can't Stay The Same,Under the Boards,10/30/2007,"Go, if you want to go
Don't want to lie here while you cry yourself to sleep
Say what you want to say
'Cause I can see by your face that something's not the Same
Hey hey everything's okay
I love you more than I can say
But we can't stay the same
Yeah
Do what you want to do
Don't want to keep you here holding so tight you can't breathe
Stay not another minute stay
'Cause I don't think I want to live here dying all alone
Hey hey everything's okay
I love you more than I can say
But we can't stay the same
Yeah
Well I've been thinking about the words I've said before
When I was locked outside and pounding on the door
I wish I said I'm sorry sweetheart I can't be
The man I lead you to believe that I would be
Somewhere deep inside I know something's wrong
I know you're never safe around me anymore
Hey hey everything's okay
I love you more than I can say
But we can't stay the same
Yeah"
Jimmy Eat World,Always Be,Chase This Light,12/03/2007,"Could've been a night like any other
One of us has to drive
One of us gets to think
I'll force a laugh to break the silence
It's gonna get harder still
Before it gets easy
You can't keep safe what wants to break

I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's all lost in this
She's all like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach

I was just a boy like every other
I thought I was something fierce
I thought I was ten times smarter
Love would be something that I just know
(Something I just know)
How you gonna know the feeling 'til you've lost it
I've been losing plenty since

I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's all lost in this
She's all like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach

Maybe something else I'm missing
Something good and you're the reason
It's a dream but there's a real world waiting

I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's all lost in this
She's all like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach"
