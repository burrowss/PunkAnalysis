Lifetime,Isae Aldy Beausoleil,Tinnitus,01/01/1994,"I want to be the cutest boy in the world, I want to make everybody love me
I'm in a kickass band, we have lots of fans(lots of fans!)
Now you tell me that I'm gonna have to justify what I'm thinking and what I'm feeling, I don't need your money to know I'm right
I don't need you to subsidize my fight
Because I'm feeling quite Isae Beausoliel, tonight
All my life it's been driven into my skull
Be successful, be happy, be beautiful. All my life it's been driven into my skull and you wonder why I'm such an asshole"
Lifetime,Starsixtynine,Tinnitus,01/01/1994,"Sometimes it feels right but mostly less than said
You feel the right to ask ""are you depressed again?""
Sometimes and even though I smile I'd rather feel like shit
I'm sure you know just what I mean"
Lagwagon,Island Of Shame,Trashed,01/04/1994,"And it's prejudice
As if he chose to be this way
They'll make him keep more than he would take
One summer morning
He left us ashamed
In some small town of small ways
The one they feared
They might turn to stone
They feared to hold his hand
And he died alone
He died alone
They might turn to stone... alone
Don't leave them on an island of shame
Your solution
You homophobic
You coward
You send them away to an island of misery
You're not immune to any disease
I can not argue when the truth is plain to see
In your beliefs, your fear of death
I see reflections of society
We'll take our last breath alone
Don't leave them on an island of shame
Open your eyes
It's all in sight
Adding insult to injury
'Cause deep inside
The truth in lies
It's not that blind
He was alone
And it's prejudice
As if he chose to be this way
They'll make him keep more than he would take
It's prejudice
Yes it's prejudice
As if he chose to be this way
They'll make him keep more than he would take
They like to stabb him in the back"
Lagwagon,Know It All,Trashed,01/04/1994,"Look at the world in disbelief
You used to follow; now you lead
College has enlightened you
And you are proud to be different
And like different bands, different types
You ain't nobody's fool

It's like certain bands remind you of someone you hated
Cause they didn't wear the right clothing
And there's only one true fashion
And a lot of the bands on the college charts are great bands
Until they get signed; then you hate them
It's such bullshit
You used to love them, you hypocrite!

Know it all
Know it all
Did you really listen to that song?
Could you ever write what you call wrong?

I remember you and I
Listening to bands that we liked
Only the songs mattered to you
But now you're a DJ and preaching that hype
""Coporate Rock Sucks,"" you know
""College Radio Enlightens You.""

It's supposed to serve as a means to expose new bands without prejudice
But it makes no sense
""Safe Harbor for the Underground""
'Til the alternative becomes the popular sound
The bands are good 'til they make enough cash to eat food
And get a pad, then ""they sold out""
And ""their music's cliche,""
Because talent's exclusive to bands without pay!

Know it all
Know it all
Did you really listen to that song?
Could you ever write what you call wrong?
Know it all!"
Green Day,Burnout,Dookie,02/01/1994,"I declare I don't care no more
I'm burning up and out and growing bored
In my smoked out boring room
My hair is shagging in my eyes
Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight
To drive along these shit town lights

I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
To walk amongst the dead

Apathy has rained on me
Now I'm feeling like a soggy dream
So close to drowning but I don't mind
I've lived inside this mental cave
Throw my emotions in the grave
Hell, who needs them anyway

I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
To walk amongst the dead
I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
To walk amongst the dead
Dead


I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
To walk amongst the dead
I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
To walk amongst the dead

Green Day,Coming Clean,Dookie,02/01/1994,"Seventeen and strung out on confusion
Trapped inside a roll of disillusion

Well, mom and dad'll never understand

Secrets collecting dust but never forget
Skeletons come to life in my closet
I've found out what it takes to be a man
Well, mom and dad'll never understand
What's happening to me

Seventeen and coming clean for the first time
I finally figured out myself for the first time

Green Day,F.O.D,Dookie,02/01/1994,"Something's on my mind
It's been for quite some time
This time I'm on to you
So where's the other face?
The face I heard before
Your head trip's boring me

Let's nuke the bridge we torched two thousand times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say

Stuck down in a rut of dis-logic and smut
A side of you well hid
When it's all said and done, it's real and it's been fun
But was it all real fun?

Let's nuke the bridge we torched two thousand times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say
To say

You're just
A fuck
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck
I'm taking pride
In telling you to fuck off and die

I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say
I'm taking pleasure in announcing this to you
So listen up 'cause you might miss

Green Day,Having a Blast,Dookie,02/01/1994,"I'm taking all you down with me
Explosives duct taped to my spine
Nothing's gonna change my mind
I won't listen to anyone's last words
There's nothing left for you to say
Soon you'll be dead anyway

No one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've meant
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing

I'm losing all my happiness
The happiness you pinned on me
Loneliness still comforts me
My anger dwells inside of me
I'm taking it all out on you
And all the shit you put me through

Well no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've meant
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing

Do you ever think back to another time?
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
And mow down any bullshit that confronts you?
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head?
To make one problem that adds up to nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing"
Green Day,Longview,Dookie,02/01/1994,"I sit around and watch the tube, but nothin's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fuckin' lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit

Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell
And I lost the key

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit

I got no motivation
Where is my motivation?
No time for motivation
Smoking my inspiration

I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun
You're fucking lonely

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And loneliness has to suffice

Bite my lip and close my eyes
I'm slipping away to paradise
Some say quit or I'll go blind
But it's just a myth"
Lagwagon,Bye For Now,Trashed,02/04/1994,"- You're not forgetting about tonight, are you? I left your name on the door and everything
- There are not gonna be too many punks?
- John would you stop worrying about the punks? They're just a bunch of kids with growing pangs, and they'll probably be doctors and lawyers someday

I fear to see the day
My friends all mate and move away
Will I grow up inside?
Won't ever happen to me
The city sights
The business types
I can see them, where are you?

Bye for now
I didn't mean to let you down
I didn't mean to drive you away
Bye for now
Now that you're not around
So many things I'd like to say

I see you and I think
Have I found the missing link
The piece that holds us together
If I had my way
I'd hear you say that it's okay
Friendship should last forever

Bye for now
I didn't mean to let you down
I didn't mean to drive you away
Bye for now
Now that you're not around
So many things I'd like to say
I didn't mean to let you down
Never meant to let you down
I didn't mean to let you down"
Lagwagon,Stokin' The Neighbors,Trashed,02/04/1994,"Friday night's a perfect night to mow some neighbor's lawn
And i'm drunk and at the helm before too long
And chris will gladly ride shotgun
'cause navigating seems like fun
Drunk and out of gas, we drive around and crash
Drivin' through the yard
There's nothin' u can do
Dave's behind the wheel and he's had more than just a few
Suburban families slumber in civility
Awakened to the sights and sounds of the yard they're blowin' down
In their death machine
Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
Dave's a midnight landscaper and he's workin over-time
And he is full throttle-- full throttle tonight
--ARIGHT!!--
He was almost home, just one more block
He had to hit that last mailbox
Dumped it in a ditch-- ain't that a bitch?
STOKIN' THE NEIGHBORS!
Dave had to run, dave had to bail
He was havin' too much fun to spend the night in jail
Had no triple A for a tow truck
Called 'em anyway only to hear them say
""hey pal, you're fucked""
""hey man, what're ya doin?""
""i'm goin for another drive, you wanna go chris?""
""ya bro, lemme grab a couple beers!""
""shouldn't be drivin like that, dave""
Dave's a decent guy like most of us until he drinks
Then his liquid mind takes over how he thinks
And then all that matters is havin' fun
Pulling off the next beer run
On one too many nights, the party's over
Drivin' through the yard
There's nothin' u can do
Dave's behind the wheel and he's had more than just a few
Suburban families slumber in civility
Awakened to aftermath, the neighbors have been stoked

Botte on the nightstand
I count disasters on my free hand now
Run for cover there's a big one coming
You'll be lucky if you're at ground zero
No one said that this life was easy
Did that no one ever live a life this hard?
It gets hard, the bills are scattered in the yard
Ashtray monument
A life spent waiting in cement comes down
After all, it's not that bad
I still have pictures, I look back
At all the things that we once did
You said ""I love you"" I guess you did

Thinking they might sing to me
But they just stared back
Broken, trainless, and black as night
Climbed out on to my roof
So I'd be a poet in the night
Beat the walls off my room
I saw the big room that is this life

This is my condition:
Naked and hysterical
Reaching to grab a hand that I just slapped back at
This is my condition:
Desperate, alone, without an excuse
I try to explain
Christ, what's the use?

Read and I felt so small
Some words keep speaking when you close the book
Drank and just about smiled
Then I remembered us in that bed
Put my ear to the door
I just heard hot rods and gunshots and sirens
People kill me these days
There's keys in their eyes but they locked from the inside

This is my condition:
Naked and hysterical
Reaching to grab a hand that I just slapped back at
This is my condition:
Desperate, alone, without an excuse
I try to explain
Christ, what's the use?

Boxcars in that little alley which is so much like the alleys of

Spectacles bought in some West Virginia or Florida or Liverpool

All about your disapproval
Still I remember the way I used to move you
I wrote you a letter
I heard it just upset you
Why don't you tell me?
How can I do this better?

Are you out there?
Do you hear me?
Can I call you?
Do you still hate me?
Are we talking?
Are we fighting?
Is it over?
Are we writing?

We're getting older but we're acting younger
We should be smarter
It seems we're getting dumber
I have a picture of you and me in Brooklyn
On a porch, it was raining
Hey, I remember that day

What the thoughtless are thinking
I am more concerned with what we're drinking

They'll laugh about it at the warehouse
Saying I'm so lame
It wrote itself
You can keep the blame

It'll be a happy song
Not unlike some other ones
While everyone's depressed and broke
I get high off your sick jokes
(Ha ha ha)

They're colossal
They're tousling
All the worried hair
Stay up there

So crazy, it just might work
Then we'll quit our jobs
We could be the next group that you rob

There are times for being dumb
This must be one of them
I'd like to know what's so wrong with a stupid, happy song?

It says many things in its nothingness
It gives me space to think, I guess
To think less and less

Moving units and tracking charts
Will they ever learn?
It isn't who you know, it's who you burn

It means nothing
Selling kids to other kids
If you think we changed our tune, I hope we did"

If I had a choice don't you think I'd make it?
I lost my voice, I hope I didn't break it
Little demons by my bed whisper secrets
The kind you never hear

I dip my toe in this cold, cold life
I want to dive but I can't find your feet
You with a view so unlike my own
I'm trying on your eyes
So I let go, fall to the ground
It's a long way down again

Petty cons keep peeling back my ears
We make plans
Collaborate and give to you my better half
Until now just dead weight, a prisoner of doubt
In a cell, we kiss and tell all our keepsakes

I dip my toe in this cold, cold life
I want to dive but I can't find your feet
You with a view so unlike my own
I'm trying on your eyes
So I let go, fall to the ground

You were from Oakland by way of the Midwest
I bought a rose and a suit with the pants pegged

You said, ""I smelled you twice today.""
Someone was passing out somewhere
We kissed a shot of Kentucky straight
I swore this life is worth the wait

Hayes broke the scissors, apologized
Our kitchen was crowded and steamy
Isn't it always?

You bit my neck blue

And put our faith in a closed door

Would anyone change it anyhow

Walls are shaking and they're closing in
Too fast or a bit too slow
Paranoid of people and it's starting to show
One guy that I can't shake
Over my shoulder is a big mistake

Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kind of weak
Saying all I know is
I gotta get away from me

I tell you, something just ain't right
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight
Avoiding my friends 'cause they all bug
Life is like a riddle and I'm really stumped
If you reason, don't you know
Your own preoccupation is where you'll go
Being followed, I look around
It's only my shadow creeping on the ground

Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kind of weak
Saying all I know is

I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
I'm just stoned

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
I'm just stoned"
The Offspring,Self Esteem,Smash,12/22/1994,"La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert
Now I know I'm being used
That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem

Oh hey yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

We make plans to go out at night
I wait 'til two, then I turn out the light
This rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up, I just might tell her so

Oh hey yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah

Now I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem

Oh hey yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease

NOFX,Drugs Are Good,45 or 46 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go On Our Other Records,01/01/1995,"Want to fuck up, drop out
Never trust a fucking hippie
And for that matter don't trust anyone
Quit school, don't work
Livin' out the music de punk
If I could do it so could anyone
Drugs are good
They let you do things that you know you not should
And when you do 'em people think that you're cool
Want to join a punk band
Shave your head and get a tattoo
You don't need talent just sing out of tune
Self-destruction
No moral to throw it on me
For no particular reason beat up everyone
Drugs are neat, and you can buy 'em relatively cheap
And when you do 'em people think that you're cool"
Green Day,When I Come Around,Dookie,01/31/1995,"I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone
And it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment
Sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user
So I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down
Because I know you're right

So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt
Means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around"
Blink-182,Carousel,Cheshire Cat,02/17/1995,"I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel
Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitude's a reason to die

Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?
I guess it's just another
I guess it's just another
I guess it's just another night alone

Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile
A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again

Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone?
I guess it's just another

I guess it's just another night alone

Green Day,She,Dookie,05/05/1995,"She, she screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
Waiting for a sign
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

She, she's figured out
All her doubts were someone else's point of view
Waking up this time
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you"
MxPx,Tomorrow's Another Day,Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo,06/16/1995,"I don't want to let my life fly by
Do you ever stop, stop to wonder why?
And time flies by when everything is okay
It just turns out that life ain't that way
Big decisions overwhelm me
And I know nothing's free
When I don't think of, think about much
People die and we don't know why
I could use some understanding
Human contact, sign that contract

I don't want to let my life fly by
Did you ever stop to wonder why?
Ever stop to wonder, wonder why?
And time stands still when no one understands you
When you don't quite understand yourself
But just know this that God is faithful
Even if you don't have faith yourself
There's nothing quite like being sure of
Whats inside your heart
It's mostly simple but not so easy
To know just where to start

I don't want to let my life fly by
Did you ever stop to wonder why?
Ever stop to wonder wonder why?
Today didn't have to be this way
Tomorrow is another day
Another chance to make things right
A chance to make sense of last night
Today didn't have to be this way
Tomorrow is another day
Another chance to make things right
A chance to fully live your life
Only you don't want to, You don't want to, You don't want to, You don't want to
You don't want to, You don't want to, You don't want to, You don't want to
You don't want to, You don't want to"

So what's it gonna take? there's no getting thru to you
So what's it gonna take?
There's no getting thru to you
I'm way to young
To have a point of view
This whole thing just bums me out, Jesus knows my heart
But you don't care you've already made up you mind
I try to change my attitude but it's really hard
I'm so sick of you, God is gonna pull thru"

It consumes you can't you see that sin hates everybody
Everybody, sin hates everybody
Even though i know the reasons why, it breaks me down i want to cry
I search for comfort in a friend, when will my troubles ever end?

Tastes do good how could you know
Its deciteful lies
And where you're gonna go"
MxPx,Teenage Politics,Teenage Politics,07/04/1995,"No i'm not mad but i think they forget
What it's like and how hard it is to be a teenager
This is a new day and age, we read a different book
Where elvis ain't the rage and polyester ain't the look
And will we change at all when we get old?
Or will we be the same? never do what were told
Well that depends on you, are you doing the right thing?
It's not about control, it's about you and me and understanding

Teenage politics it's too confusing
Politics shmolitics it's too confusing
Is it time again to disagree
About anything, everything and what's on tv
It's a vicious circle, never ending
A linear equation worldy extending

Teenage politics it's too confusing
Politics shmolitics it's too confusing
No ill never be like you ill never ever be like you
Oh no! i'm just like you!"
Rancid,As Wicked,...And Out Come the Wolves,08/22/1995,"I saw an old man on the street

He moved so slow like a dyin' dream
Like a machinist who got caught in the machine
I saw this lady and she was cryin'
She said it's hard when someone you love is dyin'
I saw this kid who was about 5 years old
He was in the park all alone, he was cold

She's all haggard she's only twenty-five
She said she never had a friend before
I said, ""Hey girl, I'll be your friend, but who's keepin' score?""
I saw this other little girl on the phone
Her mother comforts her, far far from home
The little girl's very hesitant
Her best friend lie dead on the pavement
There's something coming around
As wicked as it may seem
As wicked as anything could be
As wicked as it may seem
As wicked as anything could be
I always end up back on the hill
Lookin' down at the landfill
I always go there when I can

New generation standing, stand with anger in their eyes
No love in the city 'cause there's no connection
Been stricken with disease, a racial infection

I'm a battering ram comin' through to you

Well an eye for an eye, yeah a tooth for a tooth
Brother against brother, should be singin' with the group
The inner cities burnin', yeah it's screamin' black and blue

Pits the dogs against the cats, now who is responsible?

Jackyl was one of the one's that perished

Through all this evil and wreckage, yeah
He maintained a sense of himself, yeah

Some men are in prison even though
They walk the streets at night
Other men who got the lock down
Are free as a bird in flight

How about the hour

In a one-way line

Beat lock him knock him take him away his authority
Hit 'em, ship 'em, club 'em submitted conformity

You know I started drinkin'
You know I don't remember too much of that day
Somethin' struck me funny when we ran out of money
Where do you go now when you're only 15?

With the music execution and the talk of revolution
It bleeds in me and it goes...

Give 'em the boot the roots the radicals
Give 'em the boot you know I'm a radical
Give 'em the boot the roots the reggae on my stereo

The radio was playin' Desmond Dekker was singin'
On the 43 bus as we climb up the hill
Nothin' incoming but the reggae drummin'
And we all come from unloving homes
(I said) ""Why even bother"" and I pick up the bottle
Mr. bus driver please let these people on
Rude girl Carol was a mini-skirt girl
My blurry vision saw nothin' wrong

Empowered impassioned by every move
It's so cold outside we need a place to hide
Go to? the club to thaw out for the night
She's automatic, so automatic
The way that she moves, the way that she moves
She's automatic, so automatic
The way she moves
Situations get tricky I was feeling so proud
The bass and the drums the music so loud
She asked me if I would stand at her side
Like glue that I would till the end of the night
My head was spinnin' a million miles an hour
The chance I was takin' I get anxious around her
She put her head on my shoulder I started to hold her
Swingin' and swayin' the morning begun
I say the way she moves, yeah

I say the way she moves, yeah

Rancid,The 11th Hour,...And Out Come the Wolves,08/22/1995,"Hey little sister do you know what time it was
When you finally seen all your broken dreams
Come crashing down your door
They demand an answer and they demand it quick
Or the questions fade and the wasted days
Come crawling back for more
And I said, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?
It starts and ends with you
The face of isolation
Well that's one you recognize
When you can't get straight
It's a lonely place and
It's one you do despise
Boredom is for sale now
And the helplessness you feel
Is a wounded dove and the hawks are above
Blood splattered on a reel to reel
And I said, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?
It starts and ends with you
I was almost over, my world was almost gone
In a sudden rush I could almost touch
The things that I'd done wrong
My jungle's made of concrete
Through the silence I could feel
That my aim is true and I will walk on through
These mountains made of steel
And I say, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?
It starts and ends with you
Oh, it starts and ends with you
It starts and ends with you"

I learned your name without words
I used my eyes, not my hands

What's the closest you can come to an almost total wreck
And still walk away, all limbs intact?
And when I go, you'll be there
Crying out, begging me
I won't hear
I'll just go fast into this night on broken legs

A near miss or a close call?
I keep a room at the hospital
I scratch my accidents into the wall
I couldn't wait to breathe your breath
I cut in line, I bled to death
I got to you, there was nothing left

What's the meanest you can be to the one you claim to love
And still smile to your new found friends?
In the same confusing breath
You pull away and draw me in
I wanted you, you wanted more
I built this life and now it's mine

A near miss or a close call?
I keep a room at the hospital

Jawbreaker,"Bad Scene, Everyone's Fault",Dear You,09/12/1995,"I went to a party last night
What sick things I saw
Make-out sessions and bicycle messengers
Punks and art school dropouts
I ran into this guy I knew
But hadn't seen in years
We went into the neon kitchen
And stole a couple beers

He said his girl had dumped him
But was there with another guy
He said that he still liked her

All I could say was
""Why, why, oh why, oh why
Why is it always like this?
Either you're too mean or you're too nice.""
He said, ""I even cooked her breakfast.""

So we went into the living room
Someone was blasting Zeppelin
It sounded good
I felt ashamed
I knew every drum fill
Anyway, there she sat
Totally kissing this guy
They looked good
I mean like in love
Then I remembered my friend

He said, ""How could you do this?
You said that you needed your space
He's wearing the shirt that I gave you.""

Then she said, ""Why, why, oh why, oh why
Why are you always like this?
If I'm having fun then it's breaking your heart
Besides, you said I could have it.""
Then the cops showed up"
Jawbreaker,Basilica,Dear You,09/12/1995,"Sunken eyed best friend of mine
Why do you sit so still, still shaking?
Superhero sapped of all powers
I'll kneel beside you, watch you for hours
There's an angel on you
Leaning down to kiss your cheek
Feathers floating on air
This is my prayer for you

Steps of stone, morning bright blue
Stick of flame, a candle winks at you
In the pew, head down I'm crying
I think you have thoughts of dying
I'm eclipsing them now
Calling all allies down
I'm consumed by your eyes
Keep them open and full

It's raining in your room
Angel tears, bask sweet
Angel eyes on you
They love all that they see

Dewy palm, cemetery lawn
Walk alone in gardens of loss
You can't have a flower of stone
Never let this soil come between us
I'm asking you on a date for the rest of your life

It's raining in your room
Angel tears, bask sweet
Angel eyes on you
They love all that they see"

I can tell by your glare
I wouldn't touch you on a dare
Seven months to June
And even then, so what?
My mouth is open, my book is shut

My air guitar is out of tune
My stupid hair is so '82 to you
At least I don't fit in...

Corner me in
In Chemistry
It's all just simple math to me
Call me your names
Make them stick
I'll laugh until I am sick

Glad that that's all through
Got better friends than you
Just can't remember where I left them
I'll see you all in class
Not if I ditch first
Expect the best, accept the worst

Walk until your blush subsides
Drink beneath the 405 in the ivy
And think about that girl...

Two grades below
She pierced her nose way before it was cool
Some older guy with a motorbike
Picks her up after school

This school's a living hell
I work and don't get paid
I smoke a lot but can't get laid

Sit and stare, it's all we do
All my friends are broken, too
We're just waiting
Waiting to begin...

Jawbreaker,Fireman,Dear You,09/12/1995,"Dreamed I was a fireman
I just smoked and watched you burn
Dreamed I was an astronaut
I shot you down like a juggernaut
Dreamed we were still going out
Had that one a few times now
Woke up to find we were not
It's good to be awake

Dreamed I was a tidal wave
I ravaged your coast, there were no survivors
Dreamed I was your landlord
I showed your place when you had lovers
If I was a vampire
I wouldn't suck your blood
Then I dreamed I was you
The sweetest dream I have had

If you could hear
The dreams I've had, my dear
They would give you nightmares for a week
But you're not here
And I can never sleep
Come home so I can be a creep

Dreamed I was a dream
Stole you away, away in your sleep
Saved you from a fire
Gun for hire
Introduced you to a vampire
Wave crashed on the beach
We rolled around in its foamy grasp
Kissing in the chaos of a kelpy sea
Seems I couldn't save you from me

If you could hear
The dreams I've had, my dear
They would give you nightmares for a week
But you're not here
And I can never sleep
Come home so I can be a creep

Maybe I'm obsessive to think like this
Probably not impressing you
With my cheap tricks
Honey, it's depressing what
Depression does to some
I'll play the part for hours but
I know you'll never come

If you could hear
The dreams I've had, my dear
They would give you nightmares for a week
But you're not here
And I can never sleep
Come home so I can be a creep"
Jawbreaker,I Love You So Much It's Killing Us Both,Dear You,09/12/1995,"A week inside, I think I'm starting to show
I told myself to keep myself in line
Should we get married or just go on killing each other?
I don't think I hate you enough to commit you to me

Happy all the time
It's all we ever do
Steady in decline
It's all we ever do
I'm sorry but it's true

How can I save you when I couldn't save a dime?
I want to call you and tell you that I'm a fan
All my friends know better but I can't quite hear them
Still for the life of me I can't imagine our home

Good things, that's all I want
All I want for you
Hold me
Set me free
It's all I want from you
It's sad and it's so true

If you can't be the life of the party
You'll be the death of everyone
All I want is a life without parties
Want you as one

Watch this pot and it is sure to boil
Sometimes I catch myself thinking, ""Boy or a girl?""
Kiss me on the teeth
It's all that we can do
Punch me
Wake me up
This lullaby is blue
Lie and say we're through

If you can't be the life of the party
You'll be the death of everyone
All I want is a life without parties
Want you as one"
Jawbreaker,Jet Black,Dear You,09/12/1995,"""I tell you this because as an artist I think you'll understand.""

I'll be quiet to keep you quiet
Don't concern yourself with my slow dying
Through the vents I hear you sigh
I don't get too high these days
Your floor is my ceiling
Lights out, you can't come in

If you don't remind me, I won't forget you
If you don't ask, I won't upset you

I am jet black
I am stone cold
Jet black to the center
Funny like a funeral
I need you to bury me

White noise in black room dust
These hands long for one last touch
Hourglass all out of trust
I don't scratch so I won't itch
I don't reach so I won't miss
I taste our last kiss

If you don't remind me, I won't forget you
If you don't ask, I won't upset you

I am jet black
I am stone cold
Jet black to the center
Funny like a funeral
I need you to bury me

This is the cure: the same as the symptom
Simple and pure: break to keep fixing
Patiently nurse, patient and nurse
This is the part I wouldn't show you
The part where you say, ""I don't even know you.""
This is your cue
Be glad that it's through

I am jet black
I am stone cold
Jet black to the center
Funny like a funeral
I need you to bury me

""Sometimes when I'm driving on the road at night, I see two headlights coming toward me, fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion: the sound of shattering glass, the flames rising out of the flowing gasoline."""

Have sex a lot
A hostile climate clouds and sickens you
Two room condo, treeless cul-de-sac
A nun's dark habit
All arm, no follow through

As a favor to me
As a place to go
As a favor to me
Little stitch to sew

Loose leaf paper
At a loss for words
A can of dinner
Hard to get a rise
Hook up the Sega
Have sex alone
Stick a fork in a socket
Still it's no surprise

I think I'm coming unplugged
I just scratch and shrug
Itches in my teeth
As a favor to me

I can't watch you all the time
Much as I would like to
As I think I ought to
It's hard to argue for this life
Harder still without you
Don't make me survive you

Ripe fruit falls from the tree so bare
Dead in sunshine, decomposing there
Spoiled and keeping
Keeping tracks to pick
Fitful sleeping
Were you never sick?

Another mouth to feed
As a favor to me
As a need to need
As a favor to me

I can't watch you all the time
Much as I would like to
As I think I ought to
It's hard to argue for this life
Harder still without you
Don't make me survive you

Perhaps they're listening

I am spilled and poured
I am peeled and cored
I am hanging from the floor
Flicker like a freak through a sleepless week
In a black cell of forever
There's a point to this
A point I think I often miss
Oh clever, clever, where's your heart?
You can turn a phrase until it reads a million ways
It makes no sense but it's as good as it is sad
I am sad, elated
I am segregated
There's this stitching and it's itching
All my friends are dead
Asleep in distant beds
At least these enemies stay close
Take me to the pretty ones
I want to be a pretty one
Sign me to a nice girl so she can ruin me eternally
They offered me a million bucks
All I want's a steady fuck
Oh steady, steady, where were you?
Channel surf a sea of static
See the prize but you can't have it
There's something thankless in a wish fulfilled
I am thrilled and bored
I am unskilled, adored
All of both and none of one
I would kill for more
I haven't killed before
I could set this heart on stun
Take me to the pretty ones
I want to be original
Sign me to a nice girl so I can sing her something meaningful
In my perfect world I'd be signed to a nice girl
It would cost one million kisses"

The world is an oyster locked in a shell
You like the taste of it but can't take the smell

I dot my t's and cross my I's
Pretend that I can write
I haven't got a nice thing to say about anyone except the one
Who caught me staring, so I just walked away

No one likes to give themselves over to an empty bed
If you're gonna sleep like that
Then you might as well be dead
But you still want all the covers
And no hair tickling your face
You're so proud of your physique
But you still want your cake
I got it!

I'm passing these open windows
Passing these open windows
There is plenty to criticize
It gets so easy to narrow these eyes
But these eyes will stay wide
I will stay young
Young and dumb inside
I have just begun to forget my lines

One can become two
Two can pick and choose

I saw through your trap and into my own wrists
Saw we were through, red ribbons spill to blue
A sight to sore your eyes

Slow dance alone with no one to the sound of four hands clapping
Congratulations to you both, I hope somewhere you're happy
If there's a moral to this story then I wish you'd show me

Hair in the blood
Fly in the disappointment
Rubber, I'm glue
I'll write the book on you
It's sticking to my face

You need a little less than what you take for granted
This is the sip that's drinking back from you
Blacking out your eyes
You need a little more suppression of your appetites
This is your honeymoon, in separate rooms
It's neither sweet, nor bright

I got this dress I'm hiking it around this waste of laughter
Slow dance alone with no one to the sound of four hands clapping
Congratulations to you both, I hope somewhere you're happy
If there's a moral to this story then I wish you'd show me

I made a word to give this state a name, this game a guess
I call it ""sluttering"" it means as little as your little test
You are your worst revenge, your very means, they have no ends

They pretend to be so above it all
Or so they would have you think
I think no one thinks at all

You might show some interest
Your world looks good enough to eat
I see the ghost of a better world
Living in your disbelief in ghosts
Now everyone tells me they're crazy
Crazy people aren't so fucking boring
Wake me when you're through being cool
Cause I'm snoring and hoping
To see you beside yourself
Show me the raw stuff of youth
Would you do it for yourself?

Or for me
We both need a change
Your fear of normalcy is hardly strange

Let's be deliberate, 'cause it's obvious to me
Deliberately weird is pretty obvious

And blue only when I have the time"

Can it be my third winter here stuck in a small town
You rode your bike past dark window shades
Looked down from my roof and not hollered a thing
Can I be so sad and not so close to forgetting last snowfalls time?
Precurse seasons cold and come of age
Even cold nights can't shake dreaming trains, endless truck
This time it's not worth fighting

Or the effect It has on your career
Act like you want to act
Be what you want to be
Find out who you really are
And don't pay any attention to me"
Lifetime,Knives Bats New Tats,Hello Bastards,09/25/1995,"Ever get the feeling ideals can't take us where we need to go?
Sometimes I'd like to just maybe squash your head, but next time that i see you
I'll probably just smile and say hello
Next time that star shoots across the sky I'm gonna grab it and smash it under my feet
Who wants to be happy?
I'll sleep on the floor and I'll just lock my door
So Dave don't come and tell me ""turn down that shit you play""
I wonder what it would be like to be real deep and dark
Typical and boring yea that's me
If I made up the rules you would be not so close to me"

Keep your hands inside your pockets
And draw blank stares

Lagwagon,Black Eyes,Hoss,11/21/1995,"He knows no shame and takes no blame
This simpleton sees everything
He's only satisfied to point out other's mistakes
Never afraid to use his pride
His tradition is old
His faith a hand-me-down
The family
He wears them on his sleeve
Morale and values left under a christmas tree
Hisonce had the gift
This image in his grandparents eyes
No guns
No drugs
No rape
No end
His vacent soul is pale and blue
In empty gaze
His crow's feet are a vision of defeat
Sick an tired of the meaninglessness
The irrationale
He's desensitized
His every need and emotion
A cup half empty
But full of euphoria
His searching for the lightswith in the dark
To swith his routine
To find a reason
To find faith and piece of mind
When one to many beliefs die
It's though to see through these black eyes
Everyone forgives
Everyone forgets
Everyone is true
And noone here will lie to you
He knows the truth
He knows the truth
Here nothing's certain
Disregard what you've learned
To find faith in piece of mind
All of their gods died with his piece
I should know him that heathen's me"
Lagwagon,Bombs Away,Hoss,11/21/1995,"You've got a thing about being lame
You think you'll show us all your handicap is great
You've got a thing about being lost
You think with our concern you'll find yourself and
You'll never be forgotten
Your family never wanted this one with all of her flaws
She's trailing far behind
She's feeling incomplete
She has no will to win
Listening I live inside your room
And you punish me as though I punish you dumb
Before it's done I am saint will you tell me now I
Never could relate to how you've been forgotten
Your family never wanted this one with all of her flaws
But I wanna know was this deprivation of money or of love

This is the last time you will be denied girl
You want that world that they took away
Go pick up the pieces
Find inner strength cause I can't save you
Find the life you left in a box
The world you said has cut you off

Bombs await you
Bombs away now let them all fall down you carry the
Burden it fills you with regret you never finished that
Feeling incomplete you carry their baggage the guilt
That holds you down

Bombs away now cause life's been so hard
And so long that's why I'm writing you this song"
Lagwagon,Kids Don't Like To Share,Hoss,11/21/1995,"And now you're searching for that new messiah
It's your greatest passion
To set 'em up and knock 'em down
Put him on a pedistal, idolitrary
Wear that ring you're married
It all yours to their envy
Cause you hold a higher key of senses
They are drawn like magnets
To a genius it's confirmed
Set him up and knock him down
And your taste is so accountable
But this is no great loss
And sharing never was a choice
Burning on a cross
Gives your credit and a voice
Here to relay your beautiful ideals vicariously through them
And when he died too many
They are all pathetic
You dethrone your king
Without listening, without ever listening
Jesus Christ is realized
As he burns on your cross
This is no great loss
Another one will come
The wait is short, the search is brief
You find another faith
Another Clark Kent
Another Superman
Flashing in the pan
Taste is so accountable
But this is no great loss
Sharing never was a choice
He's burning on your cross
Gives you credit and a voice
Only here to relay your beautiful ideals vicariously through them
And now they're searching for that new messiah
Is their greatest passion
It's the latest fashion"
Lagwagon,Move The Car,Hoss,11/21/1995,"The story it grows older, the story is no story here
I never knew what it is, and there's no sign of it ending
As I am it and ought to be, they're telling me I am

Bowling race car driver, superficial hitman you're
On the list at every door, you don't bowl or race fast cars
Composition competition you drive
Just because I don't go, to the church where you reside
I might as well forget it, the nineties won't be back again
Until i'm forty-eight years old
I can be the hungry, as i eat my words again, appealing yet apalling
Rising to my falling, I'm going to extreme ends, I'm gagging on their scene

You shift, I'm the driver, over time in it's defense, I move their car
And for a moment it makes sense, but I fail them in the end
In the arms of old age, knowing only one to lose
Feeling nothing more to hide, consider life a forgery
As you?e gagging on your scene, admit to fraudulence
Driven to this thought, death is certain, faith is not

Composition competition you drive competition
Competition i? losing i fail it in the end"
Lagwagon,Name Dropping,Hoss,11/21/1995,"Cristy can't take all the pressure
Kevin hates the girls he dates

Derek beats up all his grilfriends
Jessie like to comb his hair
Hanacek is on the wagon, I tried not to speak today

You slip and fall they pick you up and throw you down again
I left them there and found them here
I was rarely smart enough to dodge the careless words
You find them everywhere it breaks you into two
Emily had sex with Joey
Chris is weird he must be gay
Everyone is smoking h and I tried not to laugh today
Every word you hear you repeat
Every word you repeat you change
Here's a quarter there's a phone, why don't you call someone who cares

I left them there and found them here, it breaks me into two"
Lagwagon,Razor Burn,Hoss,11/21/1995,"She broke up with me
Two days later...
I think she met Don Juan in Italy
She has a new man
I have a new mustache
Now all my friends are gonna call me mountain man
And everyone will think that I'm a stupid drifter
To walk the earth alone
I'll never shave again
On the night she left me
Facial hair grew miraculously
I dressed in black like Johnny Cash
And grew this beard of shame
I've heard it said she looks a lot like Sherilyn Fenn
And some times i'm mistaken for Billy Gibbons
Look like a wise man, but I'm an idiot
It's over
She left me
And she will soon forget me
She found out I was lame
I grew a beard of shame
Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
I am a new man
I have a beard of shame"
Lagwagon,Sick,Hoss,11/21/1995,"I've been living for years in question, some obsession
Was I less to live with no answers, as a life cried wolf
I'm ashamed to mention my anguish, but silence lies empty
If I say it again can I kill it, will you lend me your ears
Breathe in breathe out exhale, acting sweating
A broken smile provides them a view, projection is nothing new
Just once I would like them to feel it, suffer in my skin
For a moment stand in my shoes, filled with swelling blues
I keep this room, and this room keeps me, chained to my organs
I am quarantined, to a place that's dark, staring at three walls
The door is locked to them
Maybe now that they all know it, you'll find solace
As you're drowning in narcissism, or is it self-loathing
Cause you fought it all in your head boy, psychosomatic
They used to humor you now they pity you, and nothing's changed
I keep this room, and this room keeps me, chained to my organs
I am quarantined, to a place that's dark, staring at three walls
The door is locked behind me
If I say it again can I kill it
Because they're sick of my complaining and i am sick of being sick
Maybe these will cure you completely, chemicals deeply
Saviors until you're dependent, don't let them go to your head
I'm ashamed to mention my anguish, but silence lies empty, silence lies"
Lagwagon,Sleep,Hoss,11/21/1995,"Hi it's me, I'm bored again
All is well, I'm not insane
I've been drunk for seven days
Everything is fine
I made some friends and broke the ice
Then I ate some bread and cheese
Gained some weight to keep me warm
Everything's okay
It's me, delivering psychosis
Over the phone to you
I've colored your world blue
Ten thousand miles from you
I'm sinking all alone
Treading new waters
Where is my buoy?
The van smells like a dirty sock
Everyone has got the flu
I'd rather be just sick of you
I'd rather be asleep
It's me, delivering psychosis
Over the phone to you
I've colored your world blue
Ten thousand miles from you
I'm sinking all alone
Treading new waters
I'm missing my buoy
When I get home
The band will have it's first hit song
You and I will buy some rings
And a suburban home
I'll bring home the bacon bits
We'll make our parents grandparents
I'll take you out for breakfast at night
And then we'll go to sleep"
Lagwagon,Violins,Hoss,11/21/1995,"I am just another fool
And I have to keep telling myself
That I am just an hypocrite
And I have to keep calling you one
And I forgot to bite my tongue
As my assumption is the mother of all mistakes
So I assume the role
Open my mouth
And clumsy words escape

So why you want to be there
When you could be here
You are slipping away
I awake with your replacement
A bottle in my grasp
In a unfamiliar place
Because you put me out
The butt of a sick joke
Into this ashtray life
As you come and go
Cause I forgot to service you
And we broke down
And you can't live with my mistakes
Well I assume false grace
Open my arms
And grasp at something true

How are you
How have you been
Girl I miss you
Wanna see you again
How are you
Want to be there
When you could be here
Girl, you are slipping away
I bring out the worst in you
And you try to let me know
You bring out the worst in me
Anxiety, anxiety
I'm trying to let you go
You say I'm giving you the creeps
So I assume the role
Open my claws
And grasp for your heart

How are you
How have you been
Girl I miss you
Wanna see you again
Into you
Like a mortal stake
So vindictive
Your love's slipping away
Violins
Into this ashtray life
Violins
The butt of your sick joke
Violins
I'm trying hard to let you go

The Bouncing Souls,Lamar Vannoy,Maniacal Laughter,01/26/1996,"He was only 16 and he knew he wasn't like anyone else
Listening to his records in his room he knew
Something had to change somewhere or he would go insane
But when some years slipped by and he still felt the same
People and money came and went but the only thing that stayed the same
Were the feelings he felt when those records played
He drinks 'til he falls down
Oi oi oi oi, his name is Lamar Vannoy!
He's looking for something and
He's gonna find it
Oi oi oi oi
And his name is Lamar Vannoy!
Me and Lamar in NYC on the avenue
Talking about nothing much
With a bag of brew the New York wind
Will blow and he will wear his engineer boots
Motorcycle jacket black jeans nowhere to go
Nothing to do
So much has gone
Wrong and so much is bad but sharing
This music with Lamar there is so
Much we have
He drink's and think's
About a girl who lies
Oi oi oi oi and his name is Lamar Vannoy
He'll wake up and
Go to work with a swollen brain
Oi oi oi oi
And his name is Lamar Vannoy
He drinks 'til he falls down
Oi oi oi oi, his name is Lamar Vannoy!

He's gonna find it

There smiling at me with here blue eyes
And curly hair i couldn't wait till next week
To make the stop see her at the
Quick check paper drop
Every wedensday we'd count the papers
We'd have a laugh at the people in their suits
No one seemed to notice how she was different
But i did and i knew. Another wedensday came and it
Seemed it was right so i wrote her a note that i
Hoped she would like dear
Kiah would you like to go with me to the boardwalk
What fun it will be
We'll eat cotton candy and we'll get french
Fries with vinegar and get a
Plate of funnel cake then we'll go on the
Zipper look out on the ocean
And puke it all up all the people will scream
We can have a laugh what do
You say? that's what it said in the note
Another week went by
And she never called another week came and
She wished she had she just
Broke up with her fiance and things were kinda crazy
With her i said i understood, another week went by
And she never called but i thought
About the way she looked at me and said to myself maybe..
I pulled into the quick check at 6am to see the sun coming up
When i walked in Kiah wasn't there. The manager said
She quit she isn't here do you want me to
Help you count the papers?"
The Bouncing Souls,The Ballad Of Johnny X,Maniacal Laughter,01/26/1996,"Johnny says he's bound by only six strings to this world
Johnny says he keeps them always one turn out of tune
Johnny never listens to the kids that say
Johnny X ain't never done the right thing anyway
Johnny wears his leather like a crown of thorns
Johnny spends alot of time wishing he was never born
Johnny waits at Journal Square and tells himself again
Johnny you're the patron saint of spittin' in the wind
Johnny's got all the right scars but he'll never learn from them
Johnny's past is his guide but he can't remember where he's been
Johnny looks up through the steam of his caffine and says
""Life a train I barely caught just to find out I ain't got the fare""
I got my records of The King to keep me
The red red wine in the air is drifting
Four chords and the spite to use them
And just enough wisdom to ignore the truth"
Bad Religion,Punk Rock Song,The Gray Race,02/27/1996,"Have you been to the desert?
Have you walked with the dead?
There's a hundred thousand children being killed for their bread
And the figures don't lie, they speak of human disease
But we do what we want and we think what we please

Have you lived the experience?
Have you witnessed the plague?
People making babies, sometimes just to escape
In this land of competition, the compassion is gone
Yet, we ignore the needy and we keep pushing on
Keep pushing on...

This is just a punk rock song
Written for the people who can see something's wrong
Like ants in a colony we do our share
But there's so many other fuckin' insects out there
And this is just a punk rock song

Have you visited the quagmire?
Have you swam in the shit?
The party convention and the real politik
The faces always different, the rhetoric the same
But we swallow it all and we see nothing change
Nothing has changed...

Written for the people who can see something's wrong
Like workers in a factory we do our share
But there's so many other fuckin' robots out there
This is just a punk rock song

10 million dollars on a losing campaign
20 million starving and writhing in pain
Big, strong people, unwilling to give
Small in vision and perspective
One in five kids below the poverty line
One population runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time

This is just a punk rock song
Written for the people who can see something's wrong
Like ants in a colony we do our share

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own, here we go

My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine
My sense is dulled
Passed the point of delirium

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

I'm taking one step sideways
Leading with my crutch
Got a fucked up equilibrium
Count down from 9 to 5
Hooray! We're gonna die
Blessed into our extinction

Always move forward
Going ""straight"" will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all

Since you were so nice
I wouldn't think twice
I'd give it all away for one more day with you
If ever there was a girl to be engaged to
That amazing girl would have to be you
Before we hung out
Don't know how I lived without
Your beautiful face - by God's amazing grace
Andrea, I say your name and all I can do is
Think about the way you smiled
And kinda sorta held my hand
Went out for coffee in what must have been the smallest town in Kentucky
Andrea, we walked together
Down the dirt road by the bridge
That we sat by each other
Talked about a few things
You looked at me I looked at you
Before you know, it's time to go!
Since you were so nice
I wouldn't think twice
I'd give it all away for one more day with you"

After your next class?
Do you care when I tell you
Step around that broken glass?
Can I see you after you get out of school?

Take a ride on my Vespa, I'll take you home
I'll climb up to your window and read you a poem
I know that you believe in the one true God above

It's been a long winded, long time
I wish I'd never met you
I wish I could forget you
And what you said
You're directing your complaints to me

I'm not always sick, but often tired
Sometimes I'm having fun or wired
I don't have someone to call my own
I'm not full of all the answers
I guess that I'm an o.k. dancer
I just want to be left alone"
MxPx,Sometimes You Have To Ask Yourself,Life in General,11/19/1996,"Never quite just knew how to get it through
The utilitarian sloganeerian minds
And its time to stand up and redefine the lines
Right now
Compartmentalizing, isn't realizing
Because it's not affecting change in the real world
So get on with your life and get over mine
There's only one world and there's many different tastes
So enjoy, don't employ your state
Common goals, communicate to contemplate
The way things are and why
Don't pawn the status quo problems off on the other guy
Your a celebrity in your own world
Catch phrases only catching cobb webs
Spiritualized capital gain and wealth
Isn't the means to the end, isn't the end itself
Manifest individually
Manifest a sense of reality
Because it's non exclusive
Don't be so elusively blind
Things are never what they seem
You don't know what you'll find
Right now!"
MxPx,Your Problem My Emergency,Life in General,11/19/1996,"Get a clue, I'm not here for you
I'm not like you
I'm not gonna do what you say is right
'Cause then I'll end up just like you
I'm gonna rebel, I'm gonna fight
This organized manipulation
Learn to think before you speak
And you just might make a point
I'm just an average guy, is that hard to accept?
I live a normal life I've got no regrets
Don't make me out to be something that I'm not
I never said I was anything, so don't expect me to be
Learn to think before you speak
And you just might make a point
Why is your problem always my emergency?
This is no court of law, you're all speculation
Sex masquerades as rock and roll
And manufactured music to save your soul
So go and do your homework
Demographics target marketing"
The Offspring,All I Want,Ixnay on the Hombre,12/31/1996,"Okay...
Ya ya ya ya ya

Day after day, your home life's a wreck
The powers that be just breathe down your neck
You get no respect, you get no relief
You gotta speak up and yell out your piece

So back off your rules, back off your jive
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone, I'm not asking a lot
I just don't want to be controlled

That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want

Ya ya ya ya ya

How many times is it gonna take
Till someone around you hears what you say?
You've tried being cool, you feel like a lie
You've played by their rules, now it's their turn to try

So back off your rules, back off your jive

Leave me alone, I'm not asking a lot
I just don't want to be controlled

That's all I want

I hate Dr. Martens

I'll cut you down and give you lip

I'll be paranoid and hungry by a quarter to ten
Watching reruns on my TV
I'm laughing off my ass at Three's Company
I don't know if I'm understood
But hearing Jimmy Buffett never sounded so good

Your enemy's you and so is your life (your life)

Mota!

I'm driving down to the barrio
Going 15 miles an hour 'cause I'm already stoned
Give the guy a twenty and wait in the car
He tosses me a baggie, then he runs real far
I take a hit, but it smells like a clove
Oh fuck, I got a baggie of oregano
This ritual is destroying me
But I guess it could be worse
It could be methedrine

Your memory's gone and so is your life (your life)

But losing out just never felt so right
Your enemy's you and your couch is your life (your life)

Now that you've gone away

Leaving flowers on your grave
Show that I still care
But black roses and Hail Marys
Can't bring back what's taken from me

I reach to the sky

Time to think of what to say
Time to go right back to yesterday
Time for movements in the past
Time for something that won't last
Not just fire quick and die off fast

Things are never what they seem
I'm stuck inside of someone else's dream
Someone else's dream
Problems never go away
I'm sick of being caught in yesterday

Every day it's still the same
Different faces, different names
But still stuck here playing these stupid games
Maybe soon I'll figure out
What life really is all about
My heart is filled so full of doubt

Don't turn around, just look ahead

Bitch, bitch, bitch
Your ego will destroy you

A dreamer and a kid
Who changes every day
Someone that has to talk
When he's got nothing to say

There's shit that you need to see
Hey kid, go on and live that life

You couldn't keep me here

Just two months waiting by the phone
She grew wings and I grew wheels
And now the dust covers my heels
I sent your letter next day
No-Dozed a lot and sat and stared

I'm not sticking around to watch you gloat this time-
'cuz it gets only close enough so you'll know you'll never have her heart
Just sometimes words and long waits in-between when she tries hard
To be mean you'll never have her heart
But you'll probably hate her you know she's just a name
But with smoke in her hair i could still smell how sweet she would be to kiss
And we talked about nothing until she had to go

I sat down next to you
I thought of all the boys that wanted to
I laughed out loud
Do you hate this band too?

And I'll stay out till it's done for me
And my legacy will be one that keeps pushing me away
So it's back to engines underfoot and miles of great disdain
They never understand the way I walk
And it's you that knows it's the way I talk
That keeps me from knowing
When I should see the things you're showing me
And it's you I want to do this to
And it's looks like that that'll make me stay with you
Keep your cool I'll be home soon

Than have my heart broken by you

Second guessing
Well I remember ever since that first day I saw you on the street
I always wanted you in the worst way
But now I can't compete
And I'm so, and you're so, we're both so

You made me feel like a criminal

You kept a smile
Though I would always walk the walk

You gave it all
I gave you reason to have doubt
I had to get out of here
I took the stairs
I don't wanna fight with you if I can't be the one to have you
You sat that chair like a queen in the kitchen
I memorized the lines your eyes made
At every squint you shot my way

We would drag ourselves to bed
And sleep took everything I had
I kept it up till he would call
You made me feel like a criminal
And then there's you
You kept a smile
Though I would always walk the walk

But you're miserable
And I'm useless
Always making up excuses
I made you cry too many times

So I'm hanging up that line
I'm throwing rocks at your floor
I'm knocking down your front door
I'm desperate tonight
And I just wanna fight
It's my confusion that lets me act so cold
So now I'll go go go
And you wanna be just left alone
Put down that phone
But if you want me, just call out ""Hey boy."""

And I will rain on your parade without a sound

Driving the old wreck
Trying to make it home somehow
One more pit stop at our favorite watering hole
The ghost of Christmas past
Swallowed all our pride
We'd opened up our story books
And water down the eyes
Our demons raise their glasses singing
""I propose a toast
To all my friends""
Who's buying the next round
Cup half empty Cup half full
Perspectives and beers
They weren't failures
Just the regulars of my favorite year
They come and go
Paying their toll
From mobile homes
Decaying old unsound minds
The ghost of Christmas future
Dancing
To the click of time
The beating of defeat
Shaking in his hands
A lifetime of retreat
And his regrets were ours
A time to say good-bye
I've been waiting so long
For you to call
My old friend
To all my friends
To all my friends
To all my friends
To all my friends
To all my friends

The sad look on your face
The timing and structure

A day late, a buck short
I'm writing the report
On losing and failing
When I move I'm flailing now

And it's happened once again

Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own

You'll show up and walk by
On the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave
We'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last
When he's gone, I won't come back

Love you so much I want to kill you
I love your face so much I wanna smack it off
I love your pants so much I wanna pull 'em down
I love you!
Got nothing but love today
Whip it out and fire away
Can you feel the pain in my heart?
Where's it hurt, man? Everywhere!
Look at me again and I'll hit you
Hate you so much I want to kill you
Love you so much I want to love you
Touch me again and I'll kick you

A porch and a driveway with a big garage
But I traded it in, I kept some faith
Laid my head down every night
And it seems so far away
It seems so far away
Remember me now, cause things always change
Five long years are gone
I've done some time
Sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
Remember me now, cause things always change
Five long years are gone
I've done some time
Sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
I learned some things about the places I saw
I learned some things about myself
I guess it came the hard way
Now I know what counts
I've got one prayer, it's in your confidence
I know all the places I don't want to be
Everyone's gone, there's no one, just me
Remember me now cause things always change
Five long years are gone
I've done some time

Remember me next time I go away
For the first time in my life I wanna stay
I could count one hand here today
The only things that matter to me anyway
And it seems so far away
It seems so far away
Remember me now cause things always change
Five long years are gone

Lighting fireworks, throwing bottles upstairs in the red room
Dave carried it up from the cellar
Bowl tank and all
Now we just have to take it on the roof
We can watch it fall
Who's gonna throw the toilet, who's gonna throw the toilet off the roof?
The landlord says you've got your your laws and I've got mine
Who's gonna throw the toilet, who's gonna throw the toilet off the roof?

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right

Enveloped now, encased by my worst fear
I've never felt the nausea of longing to feel nothing
I never wanted to cease to exist, just disappear
Fear memories are all that lie ahead
Never have I felt so lost
Fear tragedy is all that lies ahead
Never have I felt so dead
Once felt so warm, now I'm fucking freezing
I am the once embraced abandoned one
I raised my eyes up to the light in hopes of finding healing
No relief was mine, I was burnt by the sun

Let my life fly by
Do you ever stop
Stop to wonder why?

And time flies by
When everything is ok
It just turns out that life ain't that way
Big decisions overwhelm me and I know
Nothing's free
When I don't think of, think about much
People die and we don't know why
I could use some understanding
Human contact, sign that contract

I don't want to let my life fly by
Did you ever stop to wonder why-ever stop to
Wonder, wonder why?

And time stands still when no one understands you
When you don't quite understand yourself
But just know this that God is faithful
Even if you don't have faith yourself
There's nothing quite like being sure of
What's inside your heart
It's mostly simple but not so easy
To know just where to start

I don't want to let my life fly by
Did you ever stop to wonder why-ever stop to
Wonder, wonder why?

Tomorrow is another day
Another chance to make things right

Don't feel bad if you haven't figured out
Cause I'm not mad there's really no need to shout
There's really no way you could have estimated
That you would ever in your life be so frustrated

If you knew what was good for you
You'd lock me up and throw away the key
You don't need me and no you never will
You never did as far as I can tell

Should I wake up and explain myself to you
Or should I not care and sleep the whole day thru
Finding the sense in everything
Is like going through my head to find a diamond ring
Living day by day is all that I can say
Something someone to believe in might be the
Other way
We can't know for sure until we open the door
Inherent choices, choices I can't take anymore

If you knew what was good for you
You'd lock me up and throw away the key
You don't need me and no you never will
You never did as far as I can tell

And I can't wait for the day when things
Turn around
You don't own me

The piece of paper you have says that you
Can get into my pocket
But you can't get inside my heart or inside my head
Money doesn't mean to me what it obviously means to you
Cause I would never steal from kids that don't have a clue

How much more can our people bear?
Need no more division
Need no more pride and I

In water smells
The skyline filled with shipping yards
And factories had me dreaming of
Waking up
Am I dreaming? is this really me?
Because I've never felt so not lonely
And if this could be real right now
Then everyday for the rest of my life
I will search for moments full of you
But let's hope tomorrow won't cave in
'cause I'm looking for someone to
Change me
And you make me feel so tall
I always want to be this tall 'cause maybe I'll be original
And sometimes things you say
Just make me think in different ways
So this is my way of saying
I could be the one who's dragged home at night
Away from all my hopeless dreams
You and me will forge some future
Because we don't want to be waiting
For something right to go wrong"
Saves the Day,Blindfolded,Can't Slow Down,08/11/1998,"So now I've made the decision to walk behind you
In the dark, for the rest of my life
And I'll never show my face again
Because it's too scarred and bloody to be enough
And I don't have the right stuff
All I have are empty boxes to carry away your heart
And I think that tonight
I will sneak into your house
And I'll sing songs to wake you up
And I'll take you blindfolded, dancing onto bridges
And you'll say you don't want to be with me
No one ever does
And no one ever thinks of me that way
But I will even drive you home
If you never let me forget about you
And if you promise me that I'm good enough for someone
'Cause I've got to be good enough for you
And someday soon I'll get it right
And then you'll see just how good I can be
So don't ask me about forever because
Right now I'm feeling lost
But there's got to be some place for me because
If there isn't, where will I go?
Will there be some place for me
And will you be there waiting?
When we get there, please catch me
Before I crawl all the way home
Catch me, before I crawl all the way home
Catch me, catch me
Before I crawl all the way home
But I won't stop until you do"
Saves the Day,Deciding,Can't Slow Down,08/11/1998,"And it's not fair- why do I have to be so low?
Oh, I feel everything much more
Much more than you ever will
And it's too hard when I can't even catch your eye
So I can't send you messages
And at night I dream of reasons I can't let you go
I don't know if it's time to crack through your walls
So thick that I can't see past you
And last summer wasn't enough for me
And now that winter comes
The cold beats harder
And no one is left alone
And I'm offering you me right now - Take me I'm yours
And I won't have it any other way
So don't let fools be carried by what I say
The night keeps lookin' our way
And you're not seein' what I'm missin'
Cause I am missing you
And I think that we should run as fast as we can
Into what we dont know
It's time to let me in
Because I feel just fine"
Saves the Day,Handsome Boy,Can't Slow Down,08/11/1998,"I said, ""that boy's handsome""
And a little bit of me wanted to be beautiful
Carrie said, ""It's hard to look in the mirror these days
When everyone has everything you'd rather be.""
There's just something about his smile
He looks so nice
I wish I had friends like that
They'd always be there for me
I wouldn't look bad
Yeah, they wouldn't talk behind my back"
Saves the Day,Jodie,Can't Slow Down,08/11/1998,"Tonight I'll stay awake long enough
To stop breathing
And I wonder how long it will take
Before I pass out
Drunk off night skies
Lying on hills
Wet grass below
Blue black above
I will carry all the weights tonight
Cause I keep remembering the day that
You said you might go crazy
If you spent one more minute with me
Well I been thinking about those days and I don't know
Is one more minute going to kill you now?
Stop me before I say too much
So now I've been alone and it's been going
But tomorrow might not come
If I don't let it
So don't forget the mornings that we spent
Deep inside out heads
Staring at blank walls
Cause that's what counts
And I don't know
But I'm trying to let you go
And I can't cut too well
These strings I have around my neck
I'm trying to let you go
I'm trying to let you go
I'm doin this by myself
Now I've been alone and its been going
But tomorrow might not come
If I don't let it so
Don't forget the mornings that we spent
Deep inside out heads
Staring at blank walls
That's what counts
And I don't know
But I'm trying to let you go
And I can't cut too well
These strings I have around my neck
I'm trying to let you go
I'm trying to let you go
I'm doin this by myself
Don't forget we sent
Letters to ourselves
Without words
And it was just to remember
Just to remember
Just to remember
Just to remember those days
That we spent in our heads"
Saves the Day,"Sometimes, New Jersey",Can't Slow Down,08/11/1998,"I called you up to see if maybe we could hang
I told you I was nervous and feeling lonely
I bit my lip, and you were like, ""fucking hell yeah.""
It made me smile
I thought of how beautiful the night would be
I thought maybe we could drive around
Talking 'bout your town
Or stay at home
I could win you over acting cool
Real fucking romance"
Saves the Day,The Choke,Can't Slow Down,08/11/1998,"Don't leave yet
It's still early and I haven't even said a word and I'm hoping
That I might upset you
Saying what I want to
'Cause it's not like you don't know I've fallen for
But it's in my head and that's where you can't see it
And I thought that maybe if I'd like to
Bite the tip of my finger
I'd stumble over words
And tell you just how far
Before I hit the ground
And I'm the type to think of all the wrong things to say
I will shut myself up
And I never come out
Close all my doors
Only show you the black spots where my eyes once were
I can say this
IIIIIIIII can say this
IIIIIIIII can say this
I will collect myself deep down
Then I'll come out punching now
I can collect myself down
I'll come out punching now

Here I go again
I'm stuck in this rut
And I'm not sure how to begin
Should I tell you everything?
I'm feeling out of luck
So I won't see you soon
Cause I know its too soon
For you to see me
If this is the last thing you do
Just tell me that it's okay
For me to have these feelings for you
And it's normal to want to call you
Oh I'm dialing the phone
Letting it ring for hours
Pretending to hear your voice
Why does my heart always
Beat before yours does?
After a while, ?you can
Make yourself
Believe in almost anything
So I'm making myself believe in you"
Alkaline Trio,Clavicle,Goddamnit,10/13/1998,"I've been on top of the world since about six months ago
Marking the first time I laid eyes on you
I lost all train of thought as I entered the room
I saw what looked like really good food
Then I saw you and so did you

I wanna wake up naked next to you
Kissing the curve in your clavicle
Kissing your clavicle

I've been on top of the world since about one week ago
Marking a time when I was drunk enough to talk to you
I lost all train of thought as your eyes met mine
Told you I thought you were gorgeous
You gave me your phone number, I gave you mine
Before you left, I said that you can bet I'll be bothering you soon
You said, ""No bother, please do.""
I've called you twice
It's been a hellish plight to not think about you all the time
Sitting around waiting for your call

I wanna wake up naked next to you
Kissing the curve in your clavicle
Kissing your clavicle
I wanna wake up naked next to you
Kissing the curve of your clavicle"
Alkaline Trio,Cringe,Goddamnit,10/13/1998,"Wide eyed, knee deep in surprise
Just below your thighs, the temperature drops five degrees
Your standby flight has just arrived
Tongue-tied, bleeding from your eyes
Even Christ himself would cringe at the sight of your scars
While you're counting sheep, I'll count my lucky stars
You were the last good thing I ever saw
And I lost it all
I lost it all

Burned out on two hours of shut eye
Eyes glazed at the thought of the next eight hours
Headwind, cold rain to wake me
You were the last good thing I ever saw"
Alkaline Trio,Nose Over Tail,Goddamnit,10/13/1998,"Cracked my head open on your kitchen floor
To prove to you that I have brains
Meanwhile, tin men are led by little girls
Down golden roads that lead to nowhere

Fine time to fake a seizure
To feel your mouth on mine
You're saving me

Whatever happened to that silly dream you had?
I want to make it real
I'd love to rub your back
Like a plane crash that never hits the ground
I fall in love with you
I'm nose over tail for you

Your voice like the sound of sirens
To a house on fire
You're saving me"
Alkaline Trio,San Francisco,Goddamnit,10/13/1998,"Choking on the thought of leaving
Drinking to keep from sobbing
4 PM, four dollar pints
The SFO, the time and price

With all my happiness aborted
The PA painfully starts boarding
I sink deep, thirty thousand feet
Into my window seat electric chair

And I was drinking you goodbye
A heart floats in the bay
From sour home Chicago
I hear you beating far away
And there's no telling what I'll do
If I don't return to you

Hopeful thoughts of soon returning
Can't put out my stomach burning
Plastic wings and plastic smiles
Unsalted peanuts to stretch my miles

Choking on the thought of leaving
Drinking to keep from heaving
5 PM, five dollar pints
Hellbound Airlines, time and price

And I was drinking you goodbye
A heart floats in the bay
From sour home Chicago
I hear you beating far away
And there's no telling what I'll do
If I don't return to you
I was drinking you goodbye

I'm assuming you have met some other guy
So I sit in my room, watch Romeo & Juliet a thousand times
And I wish I was as cool as Leonardo is.
But I'm not
I went on Jerry Springer to confess my love to you
You said I didn't have a chance and there was nothing I could do
You told me I was crazy and wished that I was dead
You threw a chair right upside my head
Today I hijacked a plane
I wrote your name across the sky: Miss Claire Danes
But they were waiting on the ground
To take me straight to jail
I'm staring at your pictures from my lonely little cell
I'm writing you this letter to let you know I'm doing well
Until we meet again, you know I'll cry a thousand tears
And I'll see you in another twenty years
I'll see you in another twenty years"

Rehabilitate with all the others
Oh! Well, I'll see ya

That car looked so tempting, so easy to drive
Just like that apartment that you burglarized
You started to run, but didn't get far
'Cause under your arm was a VCR


I'm innocent
I didn't do it
I didn't do nothin', man
This is bullshit
He gave it to me... it was, it was a present
Ho ho, not this time, my friend
You'll be in lockdown by ten
I'm afraid you can't talk your way out of this one, son
Now four walls are your 24-hour-a-day, constant companions


Well, I'll see ya
Have a nice life!"
Blink-182,Josie,Dude Ranch,11/17/1998,"Yeah, my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero just because
Yeah, just because

And my girlfriend likes UL and DHC
And she's so smart and independent, I don't think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer

And when I feel like giving up, like my world is falling down
I show up at 3 A.M., she's still up watching Vacation
And I see her pretty face, it takes me away to a better place, and

I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything
Know that everything
Know that everything
Everything's gonna be fine

Yeah, my girlfriend takes collect calls from the road
And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge

Lagwagon,After You My Friend,Let's Talk About Feelings,11/24/1998,"Here he is, he saves a grin
He wants to be the one who doesn't have to sink a level
Indiscrete, in his retreat
All he needs is just a taste of the bitter pride
He held in her name
Embrace the solitude of ordinary fucked up state of grace
Far away from the days he bared the cross she used to wear
In some resolve well aware
A little pitiful, a pin-up boy they dress in grieving wear
Well at ease in consent in the drift of undertow
He won't justify the pity from them
When he knows....fools in love are arrogant
Their sermons cloud his breathing air
He's in love with an isolation from emotion
Here he is awaiting sentence
A fool to think that anyone can escape guilt and anguish
A subtlety that can't be learned
A subtlety that can't be taught
He is caught in the lure of second thoughts
He might still care
As he settles down well aware
Bound in secrecy, his voice will only dignify their fears
But sorrow is signified
He's well aware of his pride"
Lagwagon,Change Despair,Let's Talk About Feelings,11/24/1998,"Everything that I've done here into one in keeping with...
Some earned conviction, some stagnation, some change despair
Dissapointed and odds
In a costume you can't take off
Leave it behind. I know that this time I get in for free
Our latest rendition lame
Reincarnate, return the same
Still the best times are here now
Now that I'm bored, now that I'm numb
Done, I know this is wrong
Safe in that stance but incomplete
I leave it behind. I know that this time I get in for free
Some of it's habitual
Some of it's predictable
Sometimes the change is not enough
And in the lost empathy
Memories of better days"

Answer to those you have failed
Time to clean up your room and show you are able to stop
Beating yourself down
You've arrived
A wealth of respect, a world of regard
You've always belonged
You have to go on
I just want you to feel the gun in your hand
You used to hold aspiration
You couldn't see the limitations
Even in your youth you were unsurpassed
But driven by grief and it couldn't last
Sometimes promise, sometimes goodbye
Confessed to all through bloodshot eyes
I just want you to feel the gun in your hand (yeah)
It only breaks you until you get off
I'm not gonna watch you kill yourself to live

Cover me in resolve
So please leave the imagery
I can twist it
Dissociation and obsession
Superstition and pain
I can carry them on too and bury you once again

I'd apologize
I live to hear you say what they can't
I would make amends

I'd give anything to bring you back to say goodbye"

And your love story's bad
Drama makes you livid
In a nervous always laugh
I'm fresh out of advice
And sick of standing in this harms way
Interstate, in debate, an impasse
Driving out of hope and gas
Arriving at the same mute conclusion
This destination failure
This is going, going
Nowhere slow
Drama is exhausting and I'd rather be alone
I want better friends
I'm sick of getting into harms way
And so are they
Sick of being around something
That's destined to fail
And the sum of it's parts cannot see
They make me hate life, hate friends
Hate being there
I know, that it's not funny but it's true
No one gives a shit but you

Maybe someday you'll stop"

As there's no gain in failure
You succeed at being mine
Yeah, old friend, see you there
I will be proud from afar
I can paint a picture
In a moment of memories
And there aren't many left
I am extradited, uninvited

Take a step to freedom
You and her against this cruel world
Take a breath of shelter
And exhale trust and allegiance
Liberate yourself from hell

Speak of it
The loyalties that have been broken
Mine isn't dead
One thing is true
Nothing is sacred
When everyone's talking
And nobody's listening
When we confide in all
Those friends
They're just messengers
One thing is true
You throw the matters into
Blue skies
Turning to grey
Falling out every day
One thing that's free

Late, I can stay up late
In and out of bed
Cleaning up the mess
Inside my head"

Now, all that I have
To stand on
Grieving from a different
Point of view
I learn its meaning from you
In life and death
And continue
...But faith is just a
Silent tribute
Mine is just a desperate act
Give him back
I owe him
Throw me a line, I'll suspend
My disbelief
And concede
Following your lead
Faithfully
Led into this concession with
Hope and doubt
A seemingly futile gesture
My faith is just a silent tribute
This is just a desperate act
Holding on
It's just this desperation that
Takes me home"

The sympathy
They've taken everything you want and they
Left you all alone
My setting sun, self appointed
I am a fraud
You are the martyr
It's decided and I owe you several worlds
I can tell you...
Rat in the sewer, scraps they left behind
Once their visionary, and they all have robbed you blind
Your broken records playing for
None fabricate song
Amputated creative tongue
You sing on and on and on
I can tell you why
I'm bringing you down
Calling you out
Taking your shield
It's easier now
Years have been kind
Distance between
Has given hind sight
I jumped a train
Your tragedy so easy to read
Is bitter envy
They're reaping all the lowly benefits
You missed the train they stole
And you've never...
I'm burning you down
Calling you out
Taking your shield
It's easier now
Years have been kind
Distance between has given hind sight
I'm on a train"
Rancid,Brad Logan,Chef Aid: The South Park Album,12/08/1998,"California sun has sunk
Behind the Anaheim Hills, here comes the night
I was high on junk
And the warm winds of Santa Anna feel alright
Will every crimmin' hood make a bargain with the world
Seats are successive when you're shot to the curb
I spend my day in blindness, at night I get my vision
Dodgy, cause there are no one indecision
Cause it's wild, well it's wild, wild, wild, wild
California sun has sunk
Behind the Anaheim Hills, here comes the night
I was high on junk
And the warm winds of Santa Anna feel alright
I get destructive outside obedience
I am no longer respected in this new transition
I put into effect, my long time standard
Disastrous living, disastrous living!
Cause it's wild, cause it's wild, wild, wild, wild

We can't do a thing but wait
So let's wait for one more

And the time, such clumsy time
In deciding if it's time
I'm careful but not sure how it goes
You can lose yourself in your courage

When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?

And the mindless comfort grows
When I'm alone with my great plans
And this is what she said gets her through it
""If I don't let myself be happy now, then when?
If not now, when?""

When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?

I close my eyes and believe
Wherever you are, an angel for me

When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?"

I walked right in and took a seat
Cute drunk boy I long to meet
Sat alone
No one bought me drinks
I gave up cuz Irish Boys stink!
Open the bottle
Step inside
Pop open the cork and wave goodbye
To the stupid Irish Boys
Who never get the chance
To know me
Sweep me off my feet
Or get into my pants
I'll come back one day with a real man
He'll kiss my lips and he'll hold my hand
He'll show me off so everyone knows
Kiss my ear and suck my toes
Never puke on my shoes
Sing those sorry drunken tunes
When we go out, he'll buy me drinks --
He's not Irish, Irish boys stink!
Yea irish boys stink!
So in walks this cute lad
Decides to tell me how much beer he's had
Sets me up to put me on my throne
Then decides to take me home
Right as we get to the bed
He's so drunk he's passed out dead
This is why I've come to think
Those fuckin Irish Boys, they stink!
Open the bottle
Step inside
Pop open the cork and wave goodbye

Say no to your superiors
Say no to losing all your time
Say no to corporate policy
Just say no and don't forget your spine
You say it's an obligation
So there goes your vacation
Programmed to do what they say
Obey commands and you'll do fine, do things their way
They treat you like you're worthless
Your life has got no purpose

In the dark night, I will let you impale me
Picnic in the cemetery, turn off the lights and scream BLOODY MARY!

I know why you weren't there-you spent the night in the witch's lair
I ripped her heart in two, this is the gift to you

Watch out, I'll lure in a pit of boiling brew
You said no one was as creepy as me, and we'd be together eternally
Give me back my plate of maggots, I never told you...

Found another to be mine, his name is Frankenstien
And on our ceiling hangs the head of your Miss Thang
I'll caress his green skin, and together we'll live in sin

But I know that it's not right
I probably shouldn't tell you
But I dreamt of you last night
I guess I'm not prepared to say
Goodbye, so long, farewell, I won't be seeing you again
Until next time that he goes away
You told me that you loved me
I started tearing down those walls
I really started to trust you
But you set me up to take the fall

Goodbye, so long, farewell, I won't be seeing you again

You looked so beautiful, I never will forget
Then you opened up your eyes, looked at me and kinda smiled
I was scared, but still happy at the same time
I never wanted us to be a superficial family
But, in the end, it was the only thing we could be
Angie, I'm sorry I wasn't right for you
Just what did you expect for me to do?
You know that I would have done anything for you
I sometimes think about how things could be
If you would've took a chance and moved out here with me
We'd cruise along the 101 in the California sun
Sing Descendents songs and have ourselves lots of fun
Stay out drinking really late, stumble home from lower State
Treat every day like it would be our first date
Angie, I'm sorry that you weren't right for me
I guess that it just wasn't meant to be
I quit pretending you were in love with me"

Repackaged and reprocessed for the world
I'd love to kick you in the face, break your legs
And throw you from a train

And you're with me all the time
And lots of feelings that I can't explain

I won't spend another night alone
I won't spend another night alone

Out of every girl I meet
No other can compete
I'd ditch them all for a night with you
I know you don't believe
You mean this much to me
But I promise you that you do

If I had one wish, this is what it would be
I'd ask you to spend all your time with me
And we'd be together forever
We'd buy a small house in South Central L.A
Raise lots of kids, then we'd both join a gang
Just as long as we're together

The things you make me wanna do
I'd rob a Kwik-E-Mart for you
I'd go to the pound an let all the cats go free

'Cause I'm not scared

Why are you looking for an answer
When you still don't know the question?
It's like lighting candles in the rain
Sometimes life can be a pain
But don't give up without a fight
Sometimes when you feel afraid
Don't give up and run away
'Cause two wrongs don't make it right
What's the point in crying
When you've done nothing wrong?
It was right there all along
The world is nothing but a lie
And everyone is going to die
But what can I say?
Just help me make it through today
You don't need a destination
Just to go somewhere in life
It's like throwing feathers at the wind
They come right back to you again
So why not give it one more try?

It doesn't mean you shouldn't dream
Just don't get your hopes to high

Your world comes crashing down"

And the fire's burning bright
And still we act like everything's all right
I guess if we ignore it, it'll probably go away
If you believe that bullshit please see exhibit A
Forget about friendship
Hey, let's destroy the enemy
Well, if there's one thing that I've learned
My enemies are just as close to me
You keep your problems deep inside
You always play that game of run and hide
Even though they told you, ""To see is to believe""
It didn't take you long to know that looks, they can deceive
Don't give up fighting till nothing else stands in your way
Don't give up talking until there's nothing left to say
But no matter what you do
Don't ever compromise what you believe
Don't ever compromise what you believe
Don't ever compromise what you believe"

Went on all the rides, didn't have to wait in line
I drove you to your house where we stared up at the stars
I listened to your heartbeat as I held you in my arms
We hung out at the Rainbow where we drank till half past two
Nothing could go wrong anytime that I'm with you
Like crashing a hotel room or leading up to that first kiss
Or searching for a high school that you know doesn't exist
These are the things that make me free
I feel like I'm stuck in ""Stand by Me""
This night was too good to be true
Today I woke up alone wishing you were here with me
I wanted us to be something that we'd probably never be
Today you called me up and said you'd see me at our show
But now I'm stuck debating if I even wanna go
Whitney, don't you understand that what I say is true?
I just want you to know I have a major crush on you
I'd drive you to Las Vegas and do the things you wanna do
I'd even have Wayne Newton dedicate a song to you
I only wish that this could be
Just dump your boyfriend and go out with me
I swear I'd treat you like a queen"

Just when I opened up my heart
The one you used to love came and ripped it right apart
Why do I never seem to learn that
Love is wrong and girls are fucking evil?
I guess I'll never figure out
What womankind is all about
I heard your voice again today
I'm scarred by all the lies that were once promises you made
I lie in bed awake at night
And wonder what went wrong or even more just what went right
Why do I never seem to learn that
Love is wrong and girls are fucking evil?
I guess I'll never figure out

When I was there, he kept you waiting
And I'm still here, waiting there
To catch you if you fall
I don't know why I care so much
When I shouldn't care at all

How much you mean to me
You said that I was your best friend
A real sweet guy, but that's all I'd ever be

Dig out the key, put it in the lock and open the door for her. Then you let her get in. Then you close the door. Then you walk around the back of the car and look through the rear window. If she doesn't reach over and lift up that button so that you can get in, dump her.""

Looking for something to be when i stopped to look around

Close it so beautifully
I'll let animosity unwind
Steal away the darkened pages
Hidden so shamefully
I'll still feel the violence of the lies

And miles away my mother cries
Omnipotence nurturing malevolence

Do you wanna come to a party
My friends picked me up in a truck at 11:30
This thing's at a frat house
But people are cool there
Reluctant I followed
But I never dreamed there
Would be someone there who
Would catch my attention
I wasn't out searching
For love or affection
So I payed my three in
And the girls got in free
Shined the beer for tequila
And we headed into the party

And then in the backyard
Some terrible ska band
Someone in the background
Was doing a keg stand
This place is so lame
All these girls look the same
All these guys have no game
I wished I would've stayed
In my bed back at home, watching TV alone
Where I'd put on some porn
Or have sex on the phone
Far from people I hate
Down from Anywhere State
Trying to intoxicate girls
To give them head after the party

And then I saw her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She wasn't wearing underwear
At least I prayed that
She might be the one
Maybe we'd have some fun
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
But that night I learned some girls try too hard

(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
And some girls try
Too hard to impress with
The way that they dress with
Those things on their chests and
The things they suggest to me

I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
The names she was dropping
The games she was playing
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Flys
How she's down with
The wise well-constructed disguise
Now I'd rather go dateless
Than stay here and hate this
Her volume of makeup
Her fake tits were tasteless
So I said I'd call her
But never would bother
Until I got turned down
By another girl at a party

So when you see her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She won't be wearing underwear
And you'll discover
This girl's not the one
And she'll never be fun
So you should just turn and run
Because you'll find out that
Some girls try too hard

(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
And some girls try
Too hard to impress with
The way that they dress with
Those things on their chests and
The things they suggest to me

(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh nah nah, duh nah nah, duh nah nah)
Some girls try too hard"
Blink-182,What's My Age Again?,Enema of the State,06/01/1999,"I took her out
It was a Friday night
I wore cologne
To get the feeling right
We started making out
And she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

Then later on
On the drive home
I called her mom
From a payphone
I said I was the cops
And your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?

(What's my age again?) That's about the time that she broke up with me
(Please stay with me) No one should take themselves so seriously
(Please stay with me) With many years ahead to fall in line
(Please stay with me) Why would you wish that on me?
(Please stay) I never wanna act my age
(With) What's my age again?
(Me) What's my age again?"

I don't think I can forget you now
I once sat up on my roof and examined the planning of my town
I saw the structured grid and pavement cutting through the grass
And I remembered the cold of winter running up the legs of my pants
I picked the nicest lawn and imagined the two of us rolling around down along the ground
I saw myself touch your face and I noticed jets begin to race above our heads
But I pinched my arm and remembered how much you hate me
I remembered the fact that I can't see what you need
And I'm too stupid to be aware of the beauty that you give this place
And how shitty this town would be without you in it
I don't think I can forget you now
When you aren't around I let the shades fall down to shut out
All the sun's light and make myself feel alright
What am I doing with my life?
Oh well, you've got me under your spell and I don't think that I'm kidding around
I don't think I can forget you now
Remember that the only things we need sometimes are chilly nights and warmer thighs
'cause theres nothing like being held sometimes"

Through the park, and over McDougal
The torches were blazing above our street
And just down from the sky
Casey stepped with Anna off the curb
His shoes are clogs, did you see? did you see?
They dipped in that puddle
The one catching green
They were tripping up and slipping around
Singing Rosie
And oh,oh,oh, I wanted to pull you down
Roll on top of me baby,yeah, just roll
Roll roll
We'll wreck our clothes
We'll scrape our knees
We'll taste the scabs
You, sweet, are worth these next four months
Until I bail out,yeah,kiss behind your ears
Drive off in the van
Oh my god, I think I'm dying in this car seat
Where I'll spend through winter
I dont know if I can go
I dont know, not through with you
I dont know if I can go
I dont know, not through with you"
Saves the Day,Jessie & My Whetstone,Ups & Downs: Early Recordings and B-Sides,07/01/1999,"To me, the only thing left after a while
Was that night we watched
Documentaries up through morning
Then you kicked me out
You opened up the screen door
And threw me out on the porch
It was summer then
And I drove home whistling
Down the pike, yeah
And that was that
Our one sweet night together
And under highway signs
I watched our love start fluttering
Dissipating
I counted all the headlights
To make sure I was alright
Now I'm wondering
Is it me or is it me
That can't see silver linings
So I fucked it up
I watched you go
I saw my hand not dialing the phone
And all I'm left to do
Is remember the dull room
We stared at blue screen light
Watching the strike of '59
Dreamed of wrecking my underwear
Oh can I touch your cheek somewhere
Under dark filled rainy nights
With my socks stuck in the mud, yeah
Please come dive in puddles with me
Our one sweet night together
Our one sweet night together
And under highway signs
I watched our love start fluttering
Dissipating
I counted all the headlights
To make sure I was alright"
Saves the Day,Take Our Cars Now!,Ups & Downs: Early Recordings and B-Sides,07/01/1999,"Don't you remember the last time
I was speeding down this highway
And Anna slept in the backseat
Dreaming in the autumn heat
And we turned up the country radio and
Said if you want me just say so
And I slicked back my hair in the wind
And I told you I didn't want my picture taken
But you snapped it anyway now I guess now
I guess you won't have trouble remembering me someday, someday
So I floored it, swerved around the lanes
And I kept wishing it was you
Instead of me behind the wheel
So maybe with my camera I could steal a shot of you
And go home to put in my room
And I told you I didn't want my picture taken
But you snapped it anyway now I guess now
I guess you won't have trouble remembering me someday, someday
But maybe, you'll never remember me
Maybe my face will lose these scars
Cause sometimes they keep me home at night
Where I duck under the covers and wince when I see the light
(whoa oa whoa oa whoa oa whoa oa)
And I told you I didn't want my picture taken
But you snapped it anyway now I guess now
I guess you won't have trouble remembering me someday, someday

His hair is stickin' up a little in the front
Yeah, he's losin' it just a bit
When I get home tonight, I'll miss him
In Hampshire, yeah
His glasses
The way he writes in purple pen
The way his collar falls to the left
Have you seen his ankles lately?
I know he's next to me
I feel his sweater here
But when im sleepin', it's only green sheets
And the hair down my legs
I think I'll write you, Leif
When I'm near Tuesday
Sometime before you go

Besides, a purple sky is better soaring for you, my angel
You're an angel, you little devil
As for me, I'll stay inside
I'll be just fine and I'll watch from the window

Cannot categorize the nature of this sickness
A miracle that you're alive
Stuck to the roof of my mouth with a staple
Remember last April when we saw U.S. Maple?
Somehow, the singer showed the Fireside exactly how I feel

And we say goodbye and go underground
Or up towards the sky, up in smoke, burnt down to size
At least we're still friends
At least we're still alive

Take your wings outside, no use for them in here
Bad luck to open inside
Work like umbrellas, like a broken mirror
It's getting clearer, the end is closer
Than ever before and you'll want nothing more
When your head hits the floor and you're lost in the darkness

And we say goodbye and go underground
Or up towards the sky, up in smoke, burnt down to size
At least we're still friends
At least we're still alive
And we say goodbye and go underground

As I'd fallen

You're like a swimming pool
Hypnotic blue, and I fell in
So take my hand, we'll swim around
Kiss me hard, until I drown

I wanna be your shirt
So I can hug you while you work
I wanna be your wife
So you can beat me every night

You're like a toothpick to teeth, mintiful
You're like a metaphor for something else
You're like a teen flick soundtrack
You're sharper than a Ginsu thumbtack
You cut my can
So say you're mine, I'll give you back
Take these hands, they'll squeeze back

I wasn't supposed to forget your taste
Like nights spent figuring all the ways that we came to this place
There we were alone on top of your old rooftop in Highland Park
Ask me now
Say, ""Chris, look out across the sky and tell me which way the wind blows.""
A core of coal
A core of coal and starches
A core of coal and starches within me
Even now that you're not here
I climb these mountains of houses every night
I say your name, wish I could have done things right"
Saves the Day,Banned from the Back Porch,Through Being Cool,11/02/1999,"I stepped out into the night
Put my feet down on the wet patio floor
The sky's air had been cooling
Steam rose from everywhere
I could feel drops of rain slipping off tree's leaves
Spattering to the ground
It's always misty after a summer pour
I remember turning around and looking out
And staring in and focusing on that one beautiful girl

And I said, ""Oh, who is this?
Where was she all those crazy years?
Oh, who is this?
Where was she when my heart couldn't take its beat?""

I sipped down
Warm ginger ale
Drew back a breath
And headed over to see about this girl
I couldn't say a thing and I stared open and wide
And connected with her eyes to feel my gut fall through the floor

Breeze in my window

Ignore all our neighbors
I think I'll bring you breakfast
Play Johnny Cash on the stereo
I'll sit in the lazy chair all day remembering the things you do
So when you come home
I'll jump up to kiss you

And it will knock you back
You'll fall over our TV set
I'll pick you up to dust you off
""Baby, let's give it a go.""
Kiss your thighs to make you feel all right

To taste a little sweat

Steal Cadillacs for a living"

Is tearing me apart

Maybe I should fly out to Montana

Out past the electric lines
Out where no one will know my name

Banging on the door

Won't you tell your daughter I'm all alone
And I'm not handling this well.""

I took a piss that lasted longer than you and your manipulations
Called my mom last night
She said, ""Sweetie, you don't need someone
Who's more fleeting than fall""

Don't you love those leaves?
Don't you wish the orange stayed forever?
And crickets sang in the night
All through winter

And I thought, slow down
Think of all the times this jerk has fucked you up and left you down
And hey, I choose my company by the beating of their hearts
Not the swelling of their heads, no

Don't you love those leaves?
Don't you wish the orange stayed forever?

If I could somehow make you mine

Our nights underneath ocean skies

I can hear some dogs barking in the back yards
I smell gasoline
I wish the sky were open 'cause if there weren't those trees
I think I could see for miles
The city is just beyond those clouds
And I guess this is what it's like to be really down
And holding out for something
Remembering the warm nights
Remembering the open arms of two years ago
There's nothing like this parking lot
And seeing the stars in morning

Through the swamp and trees of southern night
I'll always have those mornings in

California, where the mountains climb so tall
And waves crash blue around you
Everyone's passed out in the van
And I'm the one driving through the land

Alone and open roading
Ted's out in the seat right next to me
He's drooling on his sleeve
Who ever made up open skies and two of the bluest eyes
Must be some young phenom

California, where the mountains climb so tall
And waves crash blue around you
Everyone's passed out in the van
And I'm the one driving through the land

Sometimes taking off can open up your eyes
To everything that lies in your heart
That's when you miss your home
Trees seem a little deader
I think we're getting back tonight
Would you care if I came over?
I've missed you about three weeks now
I'm dying just to taste your lips
Could we stomp around your back yard
And wreck our clothes in the mud?

And I just want you to know
That every pool of water reminds me of you
Is that all right?
I hope you think it's cool
Sometimes a train can't go as fast as I want it to

Did you know, my sweet
That I once took the liberty of watching you in your sleep?
I rolled over and over
Trying to touch your knees underneath the sheets
Trying to touch your knees

Everything seemed a little easier
When we weren't one hundred miles apart
The person across from me
Sitting in her train seat, reminded me of you
And I looked out past her cheeks
Through the glass-light conduit
The sun had sunk
Disappeared into New Jersey

Yeah, like how I'm such a fool and oh, that I'm so receptive

I'll spin right back around
And say, ""Nick, why are you such a prick?
Why don't you just marvel in the hopes that make up this reality?
Your world is what you made it
And I don't want a part of it
Chill out."""
Saves the Day,You Vandal,Through Being Cool,11/02/1999,"Last night I dreamt you called from Costa Rica
The place you've been the last two weeks
You said, ""I miss you, oh sweet boy, and will you come on down?""
I woke up to my cold sheets and the smell of New Jersey
When do I get to wake up to you?
Tonight I can't forget that I've got these open wounds
It's such a drag
I can't forget you've gone
My ribs have parted ways
They said, ""We're not going to protect this heart you have.""

Whoa hey, what can I do?
My lungs are breathing open air
My spleen is dripping from my pants
Whoa hey, what can I do?
You've left me in the cold
And I miss you

You never told me it would be this hard
I think my body's saying so
When you aren't here, it's got to go
It's leaving me
But I hope that you're okay
Even though I'm dying
I hope that you're still trying to have a killer time
Go see the volcanoes
Go see the rainforests
I'll be fine by myself
Yeah, I'll be fine without these bones

Whoa hey, what can I do?
My lungs are breathing open air
My spleen is dripping from my pants
Whoa hey, what can I do?
You've left me in the cold
And I miss you
Whoa hey, miss you
Whoa hey, miss you"
NOFX,The Decline,The Decline,11/23/1999,"Where are all the stupid people from?
And how'd they get to be so dumb?
Bred on purple mountain range
Feed amber waves of grains
To lesser human beings, zero feelings
Blame it on
Human nature, mans destiny (mans destiny)
Blame it on the greediocracy (greediocracy)
Fear of God
The fear of change
The fear of truth
Add the Bill of Rights, subtract the wrongs
There's no answers
Memorize and sing star spangled songs
When the questions
Aren't ever asked
Is anybody learning from the past?
We're living in united stagnation
Father what have I done?
I took that .22
A gift to me from you
To bed with me each night
Kept it clean
Polished it well
Cherished every cartridge, every shell
Down, by the creek, under brush, under dirt
There's a carcass of my second kill
Down, by the park, under stone, under pine
There's a carcass of my brother William
Brother where, have you gone to?
I swear, I never thought I could
I see so many times
They told me to shoot straight
Don't pull the trigger, squeeze
That will insure a kill
A kill is what you want
A kill is why we breed
The Christians love their guns
The church and NRA
Pray for their salvations
Prey on the lower faiths
The story book's been read
And every line believed
Curriculum's been set
Logic is a threat
Reason searched and seized
Jerry spent some time in Michigan
A twenty year vacation, after all he had a dime
A dime is worth a lot more in Detroit
A dime in California, a twenty dollar fine
Jerry only stayed a couple months
It's hard to enjoy yourself while bleeding out the ass
Asphyxiation is simple and fast
It beats seventeen fun years of being someone's bitch
Don't think (Stay)
Drink your wine (Home)
Watch the fire burn (Be)
His problems not mine (Safe)
Just be that model citizen
I wish I had a schilling
(For each senseless killing)
For every senseless killing
I'd buy a government
America's for sale
And you can get a good deal on it
(A good deal on it)
And make a healthy profit
Or maybe, tear it apart
Start with assumption
That a million people are smart
Smarter than one
Serotonin's gone
She gave up, drifted away
Sara fled, thought process gone
She left her answering machine on
The greeting left spoken sincere
Messages no one will ever hear
Ten thousand messages a day
A million more transmissions lay
Victims of the laissez faire
Ten thousand voices, a hundred guns
A hundred decibels turns to one
One bullet, one empty head
Now with Serotonin gone
The man who used to speak
Performs a cute routine
Feel a little patronized
Don't feel bad
They found a way inside your head
And you feel a bit misled
It's not that they don't care, yeah
The television's put a thought inside your head
Like a Barry Manilow, jingle
I'd like, to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
A symphonic blank stare, yeah
It doesn't make you care (make you care)
Not designed to make you care (make you care)
They're betting you won't care (you won't...)
Place a wager on your greed
A wager on your pride
Why try to beat them when, a million others tried?
We are the whore
Intellectually spayed
We are the queer
Dysfunctionally raised
One more pill to kill the pain
One more pill to kill the pain
One more pill to kill the pain
Living through conformity
One more prayer to keep me safe
One more prayer to keep us warm
One more prayer to keep us safe
There's gonna be a better place
Lost the battle, lost the war
Lost the things worth living for
Lost the will to win the fight
One more pill to kill the pain
Na na na na na
La na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
The going get tough, the tough get debt
Don't pay attention, pay the rent
Next of kins pay for your sins
A little faith should keep us safe
Save us
The human, existence
Is failing, resistance
Essential, the future
Written off, the odds are
Astronomically against us
Only moron and genius
Would fight a losing battle
Against the super ego
When giving in is so damn comforting
And so we go, on with our lives
We know the truth, but prefer lies
Lies are simple, simple is bliss
Why go against tradition when we can
Admit defeat, live in decline
Be the victim of our own design
The status quo, built on suspect
Why would anyone stick out their neck?
Fellow members of
Club ""We've Got Ours""
I'd like to introduce you to our host
He's got his, and I've got mine
Meet the decline
We are the queer
We are the whore
Ammunition
In the class war
We are worker
We love our queen
We sacrifice
We're soylent green
We are the queer
We are the whore
Ammunition

Leaving the coal calling the kettle black and orange and red

NOFX,Dinosaurs Will Die,Pump Up the Valuum,06/13/2000,"This is not a test of the emergency broadcast system, this is a real thing!
Kick back watch it crumble
See the drowning, watch the fall
I feel just terrible about it
That's sarcasm, let it burn!
I'm gonna make a toast when it falls apart
I'm gonna raise my glass above my heart
Then someone shouts, that's what they get
For all the the years of hit and run
For all the piss broke bands on VH-1
Where did all their money go?
Don't we all know?
Parasitic music industry
As it destroys itself
We'll show them how it's supposed to be
Music written from devotion
Not ambition, not for fame
Zero people are exploited
There are no tricks, up our sleeve
Were gonna fight against the mass appeal
Were gonna kill the seven record deal
Make records that have more than one good song
The dinosaurs will slowly die
And I do believe no one will cry
I'm just fucking glad I'm gonna be
There to watch the fall!
Pre-Historic music industry
Three feet in La Brea tar
Extinction never felt so good
If you think anyone will feel badly
You are sadly, mistaken
Time has come for evolution
Fuck collusion, kill by five
Whatever happened to the handshake
Whatever happened to deals no-one would break
What happened to, integrity
It's still there, it always was
For playing music just because
A million reasons why
All dinosaurs will die
All dinosaurs will die
All dinosaurs will die"
NOFX,Louise,Pump Up the Valuum,06/13/2000,"She gotta walk with a silicone cock
Sticking in her ass and one in her cunt
A butterfly vibrator strapped tight to her clit
But who's got the remote control
That would belong to Louise
She's got a new pet, a real vaginal tease
You know that mommy's little girl
Is not gonna do as she please
If she don't wanna get a spanking
She likes to speak like a six year old brat
Mommy discipline me, you know I've been bad
Start with a cat then she'll move to a crop
Neither one is willing to stop
She knows that girls just wanna have fun
With four piercings on each side of her labia
A little luggage lock connecting each one
Prevents her girl from going astray
Slut, you think you've seen your master mean?
You better lick my puss and asshole clean
Treat my clit like bubblegum
Bitch make me cum
It's time for bed she'll secure her head
Between her thighs for a thorough night suck
Along with this she'll be drinking her piss
So Louise don't have to get up
Twp goddesses in love
One resides below, one reigns from above
One adorns cuffs while one covets keys
The purgatorial touch of Louise"
NOFX,My Vagina,Pump Up the Valuum,06/13/2000,"My vagina has two sets of lips
But I don't get monthly blood drips
My vagina hardly even used
My vagina's got lots of extra skin
They took my outtie and made it an in
Changing Donnie to Marie Osmond
Operation, sex-cessful
But now I gotta pee through a miniature hole
Gotta remember to put the seat down
And when I wipe my ass, I go from front to back
Cause I don't want a bladder infection
I never thought I'd miss my vas deferens
I trade it in for a pair of used cans
Now I get to hang with lesbians
Operation, paid upfront
Now I show all my friends my new designer cunt
They think I'm kinda weird but that's okay with me
Cause now I kick their ass, playing from the ladies team
There's nothing finer than having a vagina"
Sum 41,Makes No Difference,Half Hour of Power,06/27/2000,"You're running fast and missing but can't help
Convincing
The reasons you gave me are all wearing thin
It's not meant to hurt you but let me assure
It's not what I said but intentions you've read

So when you hold onto the past then you
Will break down what little is left
There's nothing more you can't ignore
And say it makes no difference to me

Now that you're older life's weighing on your
Shoulders
You can't seem to keep things so perfectly straight
With most things so basic you might as well face it
You can't help but worry it's all just begun

So when you hold onto the past then you
Will break down what little is left
There's nothing more you can't ignore
And say it makes no difference to me

It makes no difference to me
It makes no difference to me
It makes no difference to me
It makes no difference

So when you hold onto the past then you
Will break down what little is left
There's nothing more you can't ignore
And say it makes no difference to me

I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

I never conquered, rarely came
16 just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault

I never conquered, rarely came
16 just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I could still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside

I was told of story of crushed velvet
Candle wax, and dried up flowers
The figure on the bed
All dressed up in roses, calling
Beckoning to sleep, offering a dream
Words were as mystical as purring animals
The circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared
The time was so tangible, I'll never let it go
Ghost stories handed down reached secret tunnels below
No one could see me
I fell into yesterday
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay
I fell into fantasy

And everyone was dancing
Nothing could touch us then, no one could change us then
Everyone was dancing
Nothing could hurt us then, no one could see us then

The only thing I ever had was you, it's true
And even when the times got hard you were there
To let us know that we'd get through
You showed me how to be a man
You taught me how to understand
The things people do
You showed me how to love my God
You taught me that not everyone
Knows the truth

And I thank you
I'll always thank you
More than you would know

We were sure to have a blast
For you it was just another Sunday
In a small Indiana town
I went by the place where you and I
Wrote our names in wet cement
And for a moment remembered how it felt
To have no one understand
That there's this dream
And they're not part of it
How soon we do forget
The house was gone
But the piano lingers on
And so does the fire that burned it to the ground
You can take away
All of my rights to see the day
But you can't take away my love for the day
Then there's the time that you took me aside
And said I was not your only son
Childhood is so fucked up
I never had any closer friends
Than the ones I had when I was young, alone again
Just you and I
Nostalgia, wave goodbye
I think it's time for me to go"

I used to have this friend
Who took his fiance
To see Billy Idol
A couple weeks before their wedding day
The chick got backstage
And left my friend outside
Next day she called from a hotel
Asking for a ride
I guess I'm giving up on love
I guess I'm giving up on love
I guess I'm giving up on love
'Cause it really kind of sucks
Uninspired
And growing tired
Why am I always
So attracted to drama?
So here I am
Grown up at 23
Will someone tell me
What it takes to be happy?
I play in my band
And write a lot of songs
About relationships
And how mine went wrong
Maybe I'll meet that special
Girl along the way
Then she'll break my heart
And leave me crying
I guess I'm giving up on love
I guess I'm giving up on love
I guess I'm giving up on love
'Cause it really kind of sucks
I guess I'm giving up on love
'Cause it really kind of sucks"
The Ataris,Hello and Goodbye,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"So long my friend
Don't say goodbye
Just give me one last kiss
Beneath this glowing sky
We'll go walking through the park
And hang out in the rain
Tell a joke and watch me smile
As we drink away the day
And know the next time that
You make a wish upon a star
I'll be wishing on the same one that you do
And every night I'm all alone
In some burn out highway town
I'll be thinking of the day that I met you
Hello again
It's been too long
What happened to our love
Since the last time I was gone?
I detach myself again
And lose something everytime
The solution's in the problem
Temporarily alright
And know the next time that
You make a wish upon a star
That sometimes it might actually come true
Our conversation can't consist of hello and goodbye
And the silence between saying I love you
And sometimes I wonder 'bout that too"
The Ataris,If You Really Want to Hear About It,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"Another lonely seaside town
Where the seasons closed it down
But if you close your eyes
You can almost hear the sounds of crowds gone by
Another year you'll all be here
Falling in love and watching sunsets and sunrises
It'll be grand and just what you planned till
Tomorrow comes and you've said your last goodbyes
He says he'll write, but he won't write
And you will waste your time
So stay the fuck home and greet everyone with goodbye
On this lonely winter's day
While all the crowds were still away
I realized the attraction
To temporary miles and holidays
Boardwalk dreams all boarded up
Another souvenir made to be broken
Chasing the sun isn't my kind of fun
I'd rather sit and catch snowflakes on my tongue
When summer's gone I won't be sad
As you cling on to all the good times that you've had
'Cause being alone isn't really all that bad
Don't ever tell anyone anything
Or else you'll wind up missing everybody
Don't ever tell anyone anything"
The Ataris,I.O.U. One Galaxy,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"Stars are out tonight
And you're the brightest one shining in my sky
It's like every wish I ever made came true
The day I woke up lying next to you
Will you be my best friend
If I offer you my heart?
'Cause it's already yours
We could hang out every night
And watch the sun go down
As long as we could watch it rise again
Gave me a valentine
It's these little things that stand the test of time
I've saved the tickets from the shows that we've been to
And a thousand other memories of you
Will you be my best friend
If I offer you my heart?
'Cause it's already yours
Gave you this I.O.U. today
It said, ""Good for one galaxy""
Once I build my rocket to the stars
We'll fly away, just you and me"
The Ataris,Song #13,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"The time has come to say goodbye to all our past regrets
I'm sorry to inform you, but I doubt you'll really ever understand
Friendships aren't built on false promises
I've failed without defeat
In this game of disrespect
I'm a victim, a small town tragedy
Here's the difference between you and I
I'll tell the truth and count my blessings
So thanks for all you've done
But I won't let you get the best of me
You think I'm just a kid
But you don't fucking get it
I'm strong in my convictions
And don't you forget it
So many things are left unsaid
But I won't even waste my time
For us to go our separate ways
I hope you miss me when I'm gone
Friendships aren't built on false promises
I've failed without defeat
In this game of disrespect
I'm a victim of small town rivalry
You think I'm just a kid but
You don't fucking get it
I'm strong in my convictions
And don't you forget it
Here's the difference between you and I
I'll tell the truth and count my blessings
So thanks for all you've done
But I won't let you get the best of me
Farewell to all my friends
With self respect intact
Nothing will last forever
Never looking back
End is forever"
The Ataris,Summer Wind Was Always Our Song,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"These break-up songs make sense again
And I really wish they didn't
Sinatra's singing ""Summer Wind""
And I'm thinking of the night we met
Just one last time
Can I hear you say
You're my little boy
I never want you to go away
Where are you?
Please believe in me
I'm not hanging up the phone
Till I hear you say
""I love you
I need you near""
Just give me one last chance
And I'll never let you down again
Oh and what i wouldn't give
Just to kiss your lips again
To hold your hand next to my heart
And wake up with you in your apartment
Just one last time
Can I call you my sweetheart?
My best friend
Why do all good things come to an end?"
The Ataris,Teenage Riot,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"Three years gone by
And still everyone screws up our name
No matter what you do, still some things never change
Seen a lot of the world, met a lot of friends
Got a lot of fond memories
There's nothing like playing a basement show
On a Saturday night in Pennsylvania
Start the show, here we go
Jumping in the crowd
We've gotta tear this building down
The cops show up as usual
To try and ruin our fun
It's time to show 'em all
Just how it's done
Gonna have a teenage riot
They'll never understand
What it's like to be a kid today
Gonna have a teenage riot
Let's blow 'em all away
Another night we'll be
Staying in some crack hotel
And sneaking everyone in through the bathroom window
Gonna blow up everything in sight
And get chased away into the night
By some crazy bastard with a shotgun in his hand
Start the show, here we go
Jumping in the crowd
We've gotta tear this building down
The cops show up as usual
And try to ruin our fun
It's time to tell them all to fuck off
Gonna have a teenage riot
They'll never understand
What it's like to be a kid today
Gonna have a teenage riot
It's gonna start today"
The Ataris,"Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start",End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"Today was a good day
I didn't even have to use my AK
At least I didn't get my heart broken anyway
Wasting time in east New Jersey
Guess I could tell you 'bout
The snow covered rooftops
Sunsets, shooting stars, and picturesque backdrops
Or how I went and hung out at Quick Stop
And pretended that I was in Clerks
Sometimes you gotta stop and remember
That you're not gonna live forever
Be young, think smart
Stay true and just follow your heart
Remember the times we watched Karate Kid
And memorized every line
Skipped school and went to the arcade
Hung out and played Galaga all day
Stole a car and we drove to Michigan
Six hundred miles with no destination
Except to get in the car and drive
And see where we'll end up
Sometimes you gotta stop and remember
That you're not gonna be young forever
Think smart, have fun
Stay true and don't ever grow up
Out of all I've learned in life
You always keep your friends close to your heart
'Cause who will help you if you're falling down
And everything is okay
And everything is okay
And everything is okay
And everything is okay"
The Ataris,You Need a Hug,End Is Forever,02/06/2001,"Maybe you should work for Sick of It All
Or get a job with the L.A.P.D
Did someone switch your Ritalin with ephedrine?
Just don't take your fucking problems out on me
I'd buy you a little fuzzy bunny
I'd put you on my Christmas card list
If you'd promise not to take your job so seriously
And realize you don't have to be so pissed
Fuck you, dick
Life ain't all that bad, life ain't all that bad
Even if Henry Rollins is your dad
Life ain't all that bad, life ain't all that bad
Buck up, little camper, don't be sad
Maybe you could go hunting with Ted Nugent
And see how many animals you could kill
I'd pay all of my friends just to hang out with you
And take you out to Sizzler for a meal
I'd take you to my favorite karaoke bar
And you sing ""Let the Sunshine In""
You could stomp my ass into oblivion
But that doesn't mean I'll put up with your shit
Life ain't all that bad, life ain't all that bad
Even if Henry Rollins is your dad
Life ain't all that bad, life ain't all that bad
Buck up, little camper, don't be sad

The Ataris,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,Let It Burn,02/06/2001,"Got out of bed today
I'm alive, what can I say?
I'm really happy to be
Somewhere with someone who makes me happy
I took the bus downtown
All day long I walked around
I looked at all the sights
And thought about how lucky I am now
I was sick of feeling down
So I gave it all away
Two thousand miles from all I know
And so much better off today
I'm still waiting for the world
To come crashing down again
And I'm still waiting for someone
To call me up and tell me you're dead
Sometimes I wonder what was going through your head
I don't know, but I won't go there again
You make me smile so wide
When I look into your eyes
When you're not around
You know you're somewhere stuck inside my mind
So here I am today
I was lost for twenty years
I found clarity
The day I took a chance
And moved away
I was sick of feeling down
So I gave it all away
Two thousand miles from all I know
And so much better off today
But I'm still waiting for the world
To come crashing down again
I'm still waiting for someone
To call me up and tell me you're dead
And sometimes I wonder what was going through your head
I don't know, but I won't go there again
No, I won't go there again"
The Ataris,Song for a Mix Tape,Let It Burn,02/06/2001,"Today I made you a mix tape
And I decorated it with lots of stars
It had all my favorite songs
There was Jawbreaker and Armchair Martain
Built to Spill and the Descendents
Hell, I even put one of ours on it
Falling for you was the easy thing to do
If only somehow I could make you hang around
Today I made you a mix tape
To say exactly how I feel inside
And make you feel it too
These are the songs that make me smile
And cry myself to sleep at night
When I'm lying without you
I love you more than I ever loved anyone before
Hey, silly girl, I'm begging you
All of these songs they remind me of you
I hope that you like this song
Did you ever listen to the words and melody
Do you feel the pain inside
The way that it hurts me?
When you're in your room at night
I hope you'll be singing along
And make me a tape of your favorite songs"
Tsunami Bomb,Invasion From Within,The Invasion From Within!,02/27/2001,"Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
I'm caught! I cannot kick them out
Their claws are wrapped around my throat and they are squeezing tighter
Insanity is coming over me
Their every wish is my command
No way out!
I feed them, you will too!
They're gonna take control of you!
You'll know when they have got you trapped
Everything looks cloudy and you feel like you're on fire
Inhabited, I wish that I was dead
My blood has turned from red to black
No way out!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
When they come for you
They see right through your flesh and bones for soon you'll be their home
They know you deep inside, the things you can't try to hide
No hope after the first bite
Look out, 'cause they are onto you
They'll cut you open, crawl inside and you'll be lost forever
Don't try to run 'cause you're the chosen one
Your world is gone, no turning back
No way out!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy inside of me!
Enemy!"
Tsunami Bomb,Lemonade,The Invasion From Within!,02/27/2001,"Look at you now
Remember how you gave me shit
And I made lemonade out of it
Pass me the sugar and things still won't be right
Look what you've built
Now are you proud of your deceitful quilt?
Well I won't cover myself in it
The warmth has just been choking me

Now what do you say?
Can't hear you buried in the lies that you've laid
I'm breaking myself away from that chain
Too bad that you don't understand why
I'm walkin' away
And if you're lucky then someday I may
Possibly forgive you for all of it
But not today
But not today!


Thanks, thanks for nothing
I've taken all you got and started walking (I'm walking)
Not broken! Still standing!
Been ripped apart but now
I'm demanding
No more shit
This is it
I'm leaving for myself and no one else
So long!
Been swell!
See you in hell!

Last time now!

Now you're back to who you were before!
Marionette who are you now? (WHOO-OH, WHOO-OH)

Tsunami Bomb,No Good Very Bad Day,The Invasion From Within!,02/27/2001,"Why is it me? This is not my day
I burnt myself with coffee and my brand new doggie ran away
How can it be? I cannot believe
I don't have any money and I have to pay the bills today
I wish that I could run away
Myself esteem is low At losing I'm a pro
But there is one thing that I know
It'd all be good if I could just stay home
What should I do?
He told me ""I Hate you!""
I don't know where to live next year and my guitar won't stay in tune
Where should I go? I am so all alone
I broke my new computer and nobody calls me on the phone
I wish I weren't so accident prone"
Tsunami Bomb,No One's Looking,The Invasion From Within!,02/27/2001,"No sense trying to impress faces emotionless
Contact with others is unheard of
When you bump into me there's no apology
What is it that you're so afraid of?
You're staring straight through me
When will we gain back the trust we've been breaking?
How can we stop all the clocks we've been racing?
Thought that we had grown, now we're all alone
Seems that time isn't all that we're wasting
What are you gonna do if I try to talk to you
Walking away won't solve your problem
Can't you be a human being and show common courtesy?
A cold shoulder isn't what I'm here for
Does anybody care?"
Tsunami Bomb,Not Forever,The Invasion From Within!,02/27/2001,"I thought that this was solid
Stability and safety sitting in my hand
Just take a look at your life
You're all alone
Who'll be there when I need someone
Count on nobody and no one will let you down
I don't care. Just let me go
I don't need this anymore
Love is not forever
Friendship is not forever
There is nothing set in stone
You're on your own
Who'll be there when I need someone
Count on nobody and no one will let you down
I don't care. Just let me go
I don't need this anymore
I don't need this anymore
Dependence is followed by weakness
Don't be your own hostage
If I know so many, why don't they know me?
They don't know me
Just! Just take a look at your life!
You're all alone!
Now I know what we're made of
Confusion, complication, and uncertainty
I thought this was real, I was wrong
So I don't know
Who'll be there when I need someone
Count on nobody and no one will let you down
I don't care. Just let me go
I don't need this anymore
Who'll be there when I have no one
Don't expect that anyone will go out of their way
I don't care that I'm all alone
I don't need this anymore"
Good Charlotte,Little Things,Good Charlotte,03/27/2001,"Yeah, this song is dedicated (this is Good Charlotte) to every kid who ever got picked last in gym class (y'know what I'm saying, this is for you)
To every kid who never had a date to no school dance (this is for you)
To everyone who's ever been called a freak (come with me)
Here we, here we go
What? (y'all know what I'm saying)
This is for you, (what?) here we, here we go

Like the time in school when we got free lunch and the cool kids beat us up (reduced lunch!)
And the rich kids had convertibles and we had to ride the bus (fifty-five)
Like the time we made the baseball team, but they still laughed at us (you still suck)
Like the time that girl broke up with me cause I wasn't cool enough
Trick!

Things...
The little things, little things they always hang around
The little things, little things they try to break me down
The little things, little things they just won't go away
The little things, little things made me who I am today
You want to hate me now
But I won't stop know, cause I can't stop now
What? Come on. Ungh
Here we go

Like the time mom went to that institute cause she was breaking down (I just can't take it!)
Like the car we had that wouldn't start, we had to walk to get around (Can I get a ride?)
And that same year on Christmas Eve, Dad went to the store (uh, I'll see you guys later)
We checked his room, his things were gone
We didn't see him no more
Dick!

Things...
The little things, little things they always hang around
The little things, little things they try to break me down
The little things, little things they just won't go away
The little things, little things made me who I am today
You want to hate me now
But I won't stop know, cause I can't stop now
It always seems those little things they take the biggest part of me...

And I know that those little things they make the biggest part of me break down
I'm breaking down
Break down
Gotta maintain"
Alkaline Trio,Armageddon,From Here to Infirmary,04/03/2001,"I wrote the words to this song on the back of a photograph
Behind your back it goes
A little something like this is way too big to miss
I got a letter in the mail
The sender failed to let me know where it came from
Opened it up and sure enough, there we were, arm in arm again

I know it's small but my last call's been called, half an hour ago
I know it's late but do you think you could at least fix it for me?
Then I'll go, I'll go alone
I swear I won't tell a soul
I'll drink this beer and write in fear of a song everybody hates

Armageddon, let the light in
Before we say goodbye, give us something to believe in
Armageddon, we're not begging
For too much, I don't think
Need a goodbye kiss before we sink

Am I waking up at all today?
Seeing lights, feeling pain, there's my cure on ice
I can walk but I will crawl there
I will crawl there
Sitting straight, feeling faint, an exhausted smile
Screens my words but I will hear them
Here's a phrase that we all know, but I can't make sense
I don't know words but I will hear them
I still hear them
Never ran away for the sake of scars
Tried not to move but she was armed
And shots were fired
Now a hole in the head of this wounded liar
Never had a drink that I didn't like
Got a taste of you, threw up all night
I got more sick
With every sour second rate kiss
Everything I never would miss again

Alkaline Trio,Hell Yes,From Here to Infirmary,04/03/2001,"I gave up on you a long time ago
How can you blame me?
We made plans to meet and you never showed
You kept me waiting
They said everything would work out just fine
They said you'd help me
But as it turns out it was all a lie
And they're off someplace far away laughing at me
You've been there for me one time in my life
But it didn't matter
You came and went so fast all my hope
And faith in you shattered
And now here I sit alone in this room
No one to confide in
You watched all my dreams come apart at the seams
You laughed, you left, you waited in hiding

Bless me dark father I have sinned
I've done it before and I'll do it again
Cause it keeps me warm, and makes you smile
Been beneath me all the while
Hell yes

You gave up on me along time ago
I can't say I blame you
I rejected the faith in your holy rays
Is what it comes down to
They said everything would work out just fine
I just went crazy
But I'm better now having a good time
Being selfish, and drunken, and vulgar, and lazy

Bless me dark father I can't win
Without you I'm as good as dead
Cause you keep me warm, you make me smile
You've been on my shoulder all the while
Whispering sweet nothings
Whispering sweet nothings
Whispering sweet nothings
You've been whispering sweet nothings"
Alkaline Trio,Mr. Chainsaw,From Here to Infirmary,04/03/2001,"When was it that you lost your youth or traded
It for something more for them to use, so jaded
Why is it that you never said
I love you more than just a friend?
I pray this gridlock never ends
And when we get there just depends
I found out recently that you are leaving
For good I hope I softly tell my ceiling
It's better now to be alive
Sleeping is my 9 to 5
I'm having nightmares all the time
Of running out of words that rhyme
Everything that you could never say
Would never matter anyway
I took a hammer and two nails to my eardrums long ago
Before that steak knife took my eyes
I looked up to the sky
For the last thing I would ever see
For the last time I'd cry
When was it that you sold your life or wasted
Every bite of that small slice you never tasted?
I guess I should be one to talk
There's nights that I can't even walk
There's days I couldn't give a fuck
And in between is where I'm stuck
From blocks away I heard somebody screaming
That small child inside of you that you left bleeding
You stabbed him up not once but twice
Cubicles will now suffice
Some say it's the roll of the dice
I think they're wrong, I know I'm right
Every breath that I could barely breathe
Could barely make it past my teeth
I took a blowtorch to both of my lungs a long, long time ago
And every step that I could take
Is one more difficult to make
Mr. Chainsaw came and took my legs a long, long time ago
In case you're wondering, I'm singing about growing up, about giving in
In case you're wondering, I'm singing about growing up, about giving in
In case you're wondering, we're singing about growing up
About growing up and giving in"
Alkaline Trio,Private Eye,From Here to Infirmary,04/03/2001,"I dragged this lake looking for corpses
Dusted for prints, pried up the floorboards
Pieces of planes and black box recorders
Don't lie
And I've been preoccupied with these sick, sixth senses
That sense DNA on barbed wire fences
Maybe someday I'll find me a suspect
That has no alibi

But at the right place at the right time
I'll be dead wrong and you'll be just fine
And I won't have to quit doing fucked up shit
For anyone but me
And at the right place at the right time
It will have been worth it to stand in line
And you won't have to stop
Saying ""I love cops"" for anyone but me
Your private eye

New Year's Eve was as boring as heaven
I watched flies fuck on channel 11
There was no one to kiss, there was nothing to drink
Except some old rotten milk someone left in the sink
And there's no ring on the phone anymore
There's no reason to call I passed out on the floor
Smoked myself stupid and drank my insides raisin dry"
Alkaline Trio,Stupid Kid,From Here to Infirmary,04/03/2001,"There are things that used to make me smile
One of them was you for just a little while
You left me for dead so far away
I replaced you with fear and shame
You'll be happy on the day I die

There are things that used to make me laugh
But now they're deeply buried in the past
I left them there so far away
Replaced my humor with my pain
I'll be happy on the day it dies

Remember when I said I love you
Well, forget it I take it back
I was just a stupid kid back then
I take back every word that I said

There are things that used to make you cry
One of them was me for just a little while
Why is it that you had to say
Goodbye in your special way
You slashed the tires on my car"

See, I don't know if you can help me or not
Cause I don't feel sick, no I don't feel sick
But the pains in my head have almost put me underground
I don't really care if I am healthy or not
Just clean my head up, doc, I'll give you anything you want
See, I don't know why I don't fall in love
Well, maybe I know why, and maybe you could make it stop
We'll cut it up and bury it and leave it underground
And I'll take to wishing and fall under sleeping safe and sound
Just give me medicine, prescribe me anything
Just knock me out and walk me through the door
Well I have no desire
To see through my own eyes anymore
Hello, what the hell are you doing here?
You made a really strange face, this is a really uncomfortable air
I see I'm boring you, maybe I bore myself too
That's why I need help, I'm cleaning blood off dusty shelves
I've been cut up in this room so many times it might take days
And those stress cracks in the wood, how nicely they soak up the stains
Just give me medicine, prescribe me anything
Just knock me out and walk me through the door
Well I have no desire
To see through my own eyes anymore
Been telling myself these jokes for so long, well so long
I'm a has-been who is heckled on the stage
Been telling myself these jokes for so long, well so long
I'm a has-been who is heckled on this stage"
NOFX,Fun Things To Fuck (If You're A Winner),Surfer,04/10/2001,"Fun things to fuck
Fun things to fuck (fuck)
Fun things to fuck
Fun things to fuck

Fuck the front door
Fuck the back
Fuck the good girls with the knack
Fuck the government
Until they fuck you back
Fuck a muslim, fuck a jew
Fuck fans of Blink-182
That's illegal if you're born in '83
Yeah yeah yeah
Fuck a bean and cheese burrito
Fuck a bowl of cookie dough
Fuck the space between the big and neighbor toe
Fuck a cop
Fuck a machine
Fuck a jar of Vaseline
Fuck a calzone with pepperoni

Fuck a midget
Fuck a dwarf
Fuck Kris Kringle with an elf
But before you fuck it all
Go fuck yourself"
Sum 41,Fat Lip,All Killer No Filler,04/22/2001,"Storming through the party like my name was El Ni'o
When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino
As a kid
I was a skid
And no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party
'Cause nobody came

I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never going, never showing up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearing ""act your age""

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down

Because you don't
Know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

'Cause we like having fun at other peoples expense and
Cutting people down is just a minor offense then
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down

Don't count on me, to let you know when
Don't count on me, I'll do it again
Don't count on me, it's the point you're missing
Don't count on me, 'cause I'm not listening

Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat (Back-packed!)
And I don't give a shit about nothing
You be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing
Then if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringing off the hook
You're on the hit list, (wanted!) in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom should have had an abortion

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down
Waste my time with them
Casualty of society
Waste my time again
Victim of your conformity
And back down"
The Bouncing Souls,Better Life,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"Wait for the morning light to sneak up with the sunrise
Last night was so long ago, where did the hours go?
I saw the first daylight shining in your eyes
You were mine and the world was ours
Dreams of a better life can come true
It's all there in you
Just like a break in the clouds when the sun comes shining through
Momentary glimpse of the divine sometimes when I look at you
And everything just cancels out
And for that moment there's no doubt
Dreams of a better life can come true
It's all there in you
Sometimes a new day can bring a new beginning
You took me to a place no time can erase
Yesterday I was a loser, today I'm winning
Today you're mine and the world is ours
Dreams of a better life can come true
It's all there in you
Dreams of a better life can come true
It's all there in you"
The Bouncing Souls,Break-Up Song,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"""I don't want this anymore"" is all I heard her say
As I grabbed my stuff and headed out the door
With my music in my phones and my bike under my feet
Things started to look different as I got out on the street
Sometimes I see her face
In the new people that I meet
We're not who we thought we were
When we saw this dream
Sometimes when I just can't sleep
I hear the words you said to me
How did you get so deep inside of me?
I wake up and I move on, admit the past is gone
I wake up and I refine
Moving forward to the next lifetime
I leave it all behind
Sometimes when I just can't sleep
I hear the words you said to me
Sometimes it takes a painful loss
To realize you are free
How did you get so deep inside of me?
How did you get so deep inside of me?"
The Bouncing Souls,Broken Record,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"Going to the same old places, skipping like a broken record
I love you all, but I gotta get out and change this scenery
I've got to find what I'm living for
I've got to change this life that I'm living
Nowhere to run from myself
Nowhere to hide from the truth
I tried to find someone, someone who knew
Somebody to give myself to
I learned the hard way, when you give yourself away
You give away your life too
Nowhere to run from myself
Nowhere to hide from the truth
I tried to find someplace that seemed right for me
I walked the streets until I lost my mind
And that was the best place to be
When I lost my mind the truth set me free"
The Bouncing Souls,Gone,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"It was a cloudy night, or so it looked to me
I felt so lost, I couldn't say why
I needed strength to change my mind, but these ghosts stick to me like glue
Hating life, believing I was no good
It was a darkness all my own
A song played on the radio
It went straight to my heart
I carried it with me until the darkness was gone
It was a cloudy night, or so it looked to me
I felt so lost, I couldn't say why
I built this cloud to live in, it was a bunch of lies in my mind
The world wants me to believe it, so I had to change my mind
It was a darkness all my own
A song played on the radio
It went straight to my heart
I carried it with me until the darkness was gone
I built this cloud, I can break it
The world can't change how I feel
Because I know it's a lie
My heart is real"
The Bouncing Souls,Late Bloomer,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"I saw you walking past me just the other day
Another heartbeat with thoughts of yesterday
You looked the same, years are only time
I still wonder why our hearts could never rhyme
You stood beside me, you didn't recognize me
Funny how some things never change
And when you walked on by a memory surprised me
Smoking cigarettes with your girlfriends by the pool
Your smell I could not forget, that's as close as I could get
You were so fucking cool
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
All I wanted was a piece of your heart
You left me torn apart
Fuck the rest before me and their crimes
For your love I'll serve their time
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?"
The Bouncing Souls,Lifetime,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"Just like a sunny day can turn all dark and gray, this game goes on and on
Out on the streets, broken dreams, they come so cheap
No one can leave me for dead, I've got one good fight left in me tonight
And the most beautiful girl in my head
Sometimes she comes to me in a song
Sometimes she comes in a dream
She's all the joy in my heart
She's everything that I see
Days they come and days go by, sometimes we fight and I don't know why
I'll give it all up to her
Everything I did and said, I've got all I want now in my sight
And the most beautiful girl in my head
Sometimes she comes to me in a song
Sometimes she comes in a dream
She's all the joy in my heart
She's everything that I see
When we're together, there is no time, there is no space
When we're together, everything is in its place
Turn myself inside-out for her, my endless love is without form
Let my heart be the light that guides her through the storm
Tomorrow's a lifetime away
She's all I want today
Tomorrow's a lifetime away
She's all I want today"

Well, I like to rock and I love to roll
When the music's runnin' through my soul
I got no, no place to go
But my own private radio
I met a lot of people that made me feel alright
And the music's got me through the night
Go!

Well, I had a drink and I had a smoke
I listened to every word you spoke
Another story, another memory
Another day the way things should be

If I had it my way, everyone would know

Some of them split, some of them stay
Some of them walk, some walk on by

From all these people I've tried to learn
Some of them shine, some of them burn
Some of them rise, some of them fall
But good or bad, I've known them all
We live our life in our own way
Never really listened to what they say
The kind of faith that doesn't fade away
We are the true believers
We are the true believers
Well, you can fight or you can run
Hide under a rock 'til the war is won
Play it safe and don't make a sound
But not us, we won't back down
True believers all the way
You and I
We live our life in our own way
Never really listened to what they say
The kind of faith that doesn't fade away

The Bouncing Souls,Manthem,How I Spent My Summer Vacation,05/22/2001,"I was alone, I decided to get up, decided to get out
I picked up the phone and I gave my boys a shout
Told them I'd be out around nine, no particular plan
Just whatever comes to mind
Bryan called me up, said there's a show tonight
Do you want to go tonight, I'm giving my girl the night off
'Cause I'm hanging out with Steinkopf
Whenever I'm down, I know where my friends can be found
Whenever there's a doubt, I just have to shout
He's my friend, he's my alibi
My accessory to the crime
A bond that will never die
Until the end of time
Another night and we got somewhere to go
Going out, meeting up at the punk rock show
Where the air is hot and the music is loud
My kind of place, this is my kind of crowd
And we'll be here 'til the night is through
Loyal to my friends and sworn to fun
He's my friend, he's my alibi
My accessory to the crime
A bond that will never die
Until the end of time"

The rhythm hit, it got my movement off the ground
Soundtrack of what I want to be
If I want to change the world, it's gotta start with me
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
And in the end what have we learned?
Are we just faces in the crowd?
I died and was reborn again today
Hold fast to myself, make these good feelings stay
We laughed, we cried
The music shaped our lives
So tell me why our movement's out of time?
Are we so out of line?
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again

We stand tonight, hearts in our hands"

Laws that rule the school and workplace

We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're fucked up, you're to blame

Let this train wreck burn more slowly
Kids are victims in this story
Drown our youth with useless warnings
Teenage rules, they're fucked and boring

Forget when I
Don't meet expectations

You weren't the only one, two, three, four

Why do you still keep it around
When you know it brings me down?
I'm hating everything
And I know that you dated other guys
But I got to wonder why
You'd leave it out for me

Why am I still hanging around
When I know it brings me down?
I'm hating everything
And you are getting rides home in his car
You're making out in his front yard
I'm hating everything

Put your past behind me

I've got so much left to say
I'd tell you everything

Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there

She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it, I swear

Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
17 without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin' explanation

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance, I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window

Saves the Day,All I'm Losing Is Me,Stay What You Are,07/10/2001,"The moon hangs like the blade of an axe tonight
And it's poised to drop sometime soon enough
On this dump truck where I lie
Mixed up with the morning's trash
There's a piece of glass sticking in my back
And tar covering my mouth

But it's okay 'cause I'm still breathing
And my hands are free of the heap

And I think that I see that big blade falling
And I think that I see that big blade coming

And the pressure is getting to me
And the waste in which I sit is just lurking beside me
And I can't tell if it's me or the meat that's rotting
I'm gonna have to give up sometime soon

But it's okay 'cause I'm still breathing
And my hands are free of the heap

And I think that I see that big blade falling
And I think that I see that big blade coming

You can watch me disappear
You can watch me
All I'm losing is me
All I'm losing is me
(You can watch me disappear)
All I'm losing is me
(You can watch me disappear)
All I'm losing is me

To slice open a great canyon
Through the earth you can watch me disappear"
Saves the Day,As Your Ghost Takes Flight,Stay What You Are,07/10/2001,"The last time that I saw you, August of '99
I should've had my hammer and a few rusty spikes
To nail you on a wall and use bottles to catch your blood
Display you for the neighbors so they'd know your time had come

And I'd drink your blood
Feel it dripping down my throat
And heading for my heart

And as your body sags and the stench rises in vain
The people on the street are collecting in dismay
Before their eyes, your head lifts towards the sky
And that's the last thing they'll remember of you

Cause I'd drink your blood
Feel it dripping down my throat
And heading for my heart

You've become a ghost
You're floating somewhere in between
The waking world and a landscape of dreams
Well it is nothing but dying
Got a grenade stuck in your teeth and you're pulling at the pin
You're an illusion, just a shadow flickering underneath the sun

And I'd drink your blood
Feel it dripping down my throat
And heading for my heart"

You're two floors down getting high in the back room
If I flooded out your house, do you think you'd make it out?
Or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs?
And at your funeral I will sing the requiem

This song will become the anthem of your underground
You're two floors down getting high in the back room
If I flooded out your house, do you think you'd make it out?
Or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs?

And at your funeral I will sing the requiem
I'd offer you my hand
It would hurt too much to watch you die

And you can bet that when we mourn the death of you that night
They'll lay me on the dinner table, I will be the pig
With the apple in my mouth, the food that celebrates your end

And at your funeral I will sing the requiem
I'd offer you my hand
It would hurt too much to watch you die
And at your funeral I will sing the requiem
I'd offer you my hand
It would hurt too much to watch you die"
Saves the Day,Cars & Calories,Stay What You Are,07/10/2001,"Her life was magazines and faithful TV screens
Selling an empty dream of cars and calories
Everything in between the sun and Saturn's ring
The price tag can't be seen

And it took bites out of her insides
'Til she was just a hollow shell

Grew up in east L.A
Watching celebrities
Living out all her dreams
The plastic canopy of U.S. royalty
Drew her gaze towards the sky
Away from her own mind

And it took bites out of her insides
'Til she was just a hollow shell

And at her home her mother cried
'Cause daddy had something on the side
They didn't look up when she sighed

When August came around
Bathing suits on the ground
Replaced by a cotton cloak
To see her own reflection was like squinting in the sun
And when all tomorrow brings is a set of broken wings

Well it takes bites out of your insides
'Til you are just a hollow shell
And it took bites out of her insides
'Til she was just a hollow shell"

And buy a bucket full of diamonds
But even the most beautiful of all roses
Must someday crumble to dust and fade away
It's certain tragedy

So, it's on into the lonely nights and all the rest of it
The empty space between me and the sunken walls
And feeling someone's hand around my neck
Choking away the life that I have left

And I can finally see that the further I go
I'm only treading ground I don't want to know
I'll probably hang upside down
From wooden rafters in my home
And look at old photos of you

So, it's on into the lonely nights and all the rest of it
The empty space between me and the sunken walls
And feeling someone's hand around my neck
Choking away the life that I have left

I miss the warmth of the summer
When we were on our own
But now it's winter and my bones are cold

And now I finally see that the further we go
We're only treading ground that we already know

After our third round
Of pouring whiskey down
The barrel of our guts
Grab hold of your hand

And we're yelling through the streets
And I'm out of my fucking mind

And I know you're next to me
But I must confess
What's in my head

Keep pumping now
Legs to beat the ground
And our hearts to beat the band
Sky's on fire again
Run down this alleyway
Lightning bolts again
We become fireflies
Just flashing at the ends
Rattle garbage cans
Prepare to be ravaged
By our lust, burning mad
To find that we've become

And I know you're under me
But I must confess
What's in my head

To me you are the light
From a light bulb  breaks sometimes
And the tender warmth inside
Is released into my life
To me you are the light
From a light bulb  breaks sometimes
And the tender warmth inside
Is released into my life

And it smothers me in flames
That lick and scorch my face
As the smoke reaches the sky
Know I'm burning tonight
Know I'm burning tonight
Know I'm burning tonight
Know I'm burning tonight
Know I'll burn for you tonight"

Slide under the back door
Rendering me freakish and dazed

Well, here I am
Don't know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when you're around me
To shut me out

So I'll go walking in the streets
'Til my heels bleed
And I'll sing out my song
In case the birds wish to sing along
And I'll dig a tunnel to the center of the universe

Well, here I am
Don't know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when you're around me
To shut me out

I'll make my way across the frozen sea
Beyond the blank horizon
Where I can forget you and me
And get a decent night's sleep

Well, here I am
Don't know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when you're around me
To shut me out
Well, here I am
Don't know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when you're around me
To shut me out

To shut me out

For whatever mood you're in

Isn't that what you expect?
I can sing you to sleep

Got a mouth full of blood
And I'll carry this casket if it's what I have to do
So, bring on the dark sky
Let it cover me entirely

Isn't that what you expect?
I can sing you to sleep
And all you want from me
Is a broken heart

And I'll run down to the river
Grab five buckets of water
Wait right where you are
And I will serve you at your table
Hope you like my restaurant
And the lighting is right
The jukebox is in the corner
My mouth is the speaker
And it plays your favorite songs
And you know where the coin slot is

Isn't that what you expect?
I can sing you to sleep
And all you want from me
Is a broken heart
Isn't that what you expect?
I can sing you to sleep
And all you want from me
Is a broken heart
A broken heart"
Saves the Day,Nightingale,Stay What You Are,07/10/2001,"And I will flail under these lights
That seep down from the bitter sky tonight
And I will kick and beat my wrists together
And feel an ocean breathing waves
Feel them licking at my face
Ceilings don't exist
And there are no floors beneath me
If I were king of this night
Would you become my queen?

And I hope, your majesty
That you like your position
I'll do everything I can
To keep you by my side
And I'll stare off through the darkness
To find us a kingdom
Just kiss me before I go

I'll have to walk a thousand miles
Just to find the ground deserving of your feet
You could throw me down
And walk on me
And I'd just look on through my love
And through the haze

And I hope, your majesty
That you like your position
I'll do everything I can
To keep you by my side
And I'll stare off through the darkness
To find us a kingdom
Just kiss me before I go

The nightingales are singing loud
They're calling out our marriage
To our subjects on their knees
Their jewelry is thrown into the air
They sigh at the release
As their shackles hit the ground
The trumpets call out now
We're home at last

And I hope, your majesty
That you like your position
I'll do everything I can
To keep you by my side
And I'll stare off through the darkness
To find us a kingdom
Just kiss me before I go"
Saves the Day,See You,Stay What You Are,07/10/2001,"My gut is burning
Won't you find me some water?
Hey, just forget it can you bring me gasoline?
Collect a couple forks
Hold them three feet apart
Wait for lightning to strike to burn me up

'Cause I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today

My head is swirling
Been carried off in the sky
And where it lands is where it lands
I guess that I will get another head
Then get on with my life
Leave you somewhere beneath the waves of time
And I'll wear glass shoes and plastic wrap
No, I'll just wear my insides
You want to know who I really am?
Yeah, so do I
Yeah, so do I

'Cause I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today
And I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today
Right now, I am turning off the lights
'Cause I don't think
I have got the stomach to stomach calling you today
And I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today
I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today"
Saves the Day,This Is Not an Exit,Stay What You Are,07/10/2001,"Tonight will be the night that we begin to ease the plugs out of the dam
And we will stand knee deep in the flow
The undertow will grab our heels and won't let go
And while we hold, our legs quivering
The water rises now to our teeth when we just let go

And sail belly up to the clouds, the rocks scraping our backs
To breathe in the air will be the only thing that we have

And all the wasted nights and empty moments in our lives
Are flushed away as we sway with the rhythm of the waves bobbing us up
Crests fall to troughs as we feel our gills open up

And sail belly up to the clouds, the rocks scraping our backs
To breathe in the air will be the only thing that we have

And if the hook sets in the bottom of our lungs
We'll rip it out and lick the blood off with our tongues

Despair can ravage you if you turn your head around
To look down the path that's lead you here, cause what can you change?
You're a vessel now floating down the waterways
You can take your rudder and aim your ship
Just don't bother with the things left in your wake

Just sail belly up to the clouds, the rocks scraping your back
To breathe in the air will be the only thing that you have
And your love will be warm nights with pockets of moonlight
Spotlighting you as you drift, the actor in this play
And you walk across the stage, take a bow, hear the applause
And as the curtain falls, just know you did it all
The best that you knew how and you can hear them cheering now
So let a smile out and show your teeth cause you know you lived it well"

Then only to pretend

Don't you know I'm thinking (know I'm thinking)
Driving 405 past midnight
You know I miss you (don't you know that I miss you?)
Ninth and Ash on a Tuesday night
I would write to you from Museum Mile
A toast to you: your whisper, your smile
Up the stairs at Weatherford
A ghost each place I hide

Would you mean this please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?
Won't you get your story straight
If you don't know, honey, why'd you just say so?
'Cause I need this now more than I ever did
If you don't well, honey, then you don't

I left you waiting (I know I left you waiting)
At the least could we be friends?
Should have never started (never started)
Ain't that the way it always ends?
On my life I'll try today
There's so much I've felt I should say but
Even if your heart would listen
I doubt I could explain

If you don't well, honey, then you don't
If you don't well, honey, then you don't


So here we are now
A sip of wine a sip of water
Someday maybe
Maybe someday we'll be smarter
And I'm sorry that I'm such a mess
I drank all my money could get and
Took everything you let me have
And then I never loved you back

If you don't don't know, why would you say so?
Would you mean the please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?
Won't you get your story straight?
If you don't know, honey, why'd you just say so?

I waited 'til 11

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me
Tonight

And maybe when the night is dead
I'll crawl into my bed
I'm staring at these four walls again
I'll try to think about the last time I had a good time
Everyone's got somewhere to go
And they're gonna leave me here on my own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me

What the hell is wrong with me?
Don't fit in with anybody
How did this happen to me?

This house is haunted, it's so pathetic, it makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say, the words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home, I'd read it every day

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost
It's not right

Their anger hurts my ears, been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems, they never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday, we get along so why can't they?
If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants, then why is there so much pain?

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone

When every step I take is always too small
Maybe it's just something I can't admit but lately
I feel like I don't give a shit

Motivation such an aggravation
Accusations don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration never hard to break it
Situation never what you want it to be

What's the point of never making mistakes
Self-indulgence is such a hard habit to break
It's all just a waste of time in the end
I don't care, so why should I even pretend

Motivation such an aggravation
Accusations don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration never hard to break it
Situation never what you wanted

Nothing's new, everything's the same
It keeps on dragging me down, it's getting kind of lame
I'm falling further behind, there's nothing to explain
No matter what you say nothing's gonna change my mind

Can't depend on doubt until the end
It seems like leaving friends has become this years trend
And though I can't pretend, afraid to be this way
It's not the same but who's to blame
For all those stupid things I never said

And I'm still waiting for a good day
I think I've held this long enough
I think it's safe to tell you some things
It's not just what you say to people
And it's not the way you look at me
It's the way you present yourself
For all your worst critics to see


Then you were gone
All this time you just didn't know it yet


Another tragic case of feeling
Bruised and broken
Another tragic case and I've been
Still waiting for a good day"

Can you tell
That I'm losing myself
I think I'm trying too hard to
Let it show
To let you know
Don't trace your footsteps back to me

Cause I've been gone for a long time
Waiting on the sidelines
Hoping for a chance to play
Well I thought I would never leave anything behind
I also never thought I'd say


Can you tell
That I don't know myself
I need someone to remind me
To let it go
Please let me know
Don't trace your footsteps back to me



And if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't expect anything less


Forget my name"

That the way I feel is all I have
It could take a lifetime
To realize that you're alright
But she said

I'd know when you would come back
It's been a summer

It's burning up in here
Even though the bed is cold on your side
I'd rather die
Than spend this night here without you

I would try to fix these flaws of mine
If I could just see you for one more time
And I'm trying to convince myself
That the way I feel is all I have
I don't believe in sure things
There's pain in what the truth brings



I'd be the first one to know
If its smart for me to just let it go
I'll be the laughing stock of all time
Person most likely to find
Deciding if it's fate that made you avoid me to this day

That we still talk
It's just for show, isn't it?
It's my fault that it fell apart

Just maybe
You need this
And I didn't mean to
Lead you on

You were everything I wanted
But I just can't finish what I've started
There's no room left here on my back for you
It was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true
I'd still pick my friends over you
My friends over you

Please tell me everything
That you think that I should know
About all the plans you made
When I was nowhere to be found
And it's alright to forget
That we still talk
Its just for fun, isn't it?
It's my fault that it fell apart

Sort this out on your own time
Go on and sort this out on your own time

Before you jump to conclusions
About all the friends I have
Just remember they were born that way
Word travels fast when her name's involved

No matter how stupid I get you'll always want more"

I heard about the bad news today
A crowd of people around you
Telling you it's okay
And everything happens for a reason

When you lose a part of yourself
To somebody you know
It takes a lot to let go
Every breath that you remember
Pictures fade away but memory is forever

An empty chair at all the tables
And I'll be seeing you when all my days boil down
But it's better where you're going anyway

I'm sorry
I heard about the bad news today
It's really hard to get through
Tough times and long days
But it really just depends on the season



For now we'll say goodbye
We know it's not the last time
I've lost the best part of my day
But it's better where you're going anyway

Or what you were wearing
It's unclear about how we met
All I know it was the best conversation that I've ever had
To this day I never found someone
With eyes as wide as yours
I've been searching up and down this coast
Overlooking what I need the most

Did you notice I was afraid?
I thought I'd run out of things to say
Two more hours until today burns this away
And it starts all over again
The sky will never look the same again
Till you show me how it could be
The sky will never look the same again
Till you show me how it could be

And everything else is irrelevant
To the story so far
A coincidence that you look like her from a far
Is it true that you like to sleep alone?
Or is it what you just tell everyone?


And when the world turns over
Ill keep my ears to the wall
And when the world turns over
Ill keep my feet straight on the ground"

Someones in your house
The button the button the button the button the button the button the button the button the button
I'm sick of smiling
Hey this one was supposed to be on the hidden track on our last record
But Jordan got mad high and left the studio before we could do it
Shut up dude what you talking about?
Make way for the queen
Someone get my car out

Everyone has toothpick on their table

Everyone has toothpick on their table
We like the dental floss and
I forgot the words hold on"

Don't want to grow

The lights were off
When I got home
Black room, blue phone
Hey, I know your name
Weren't we almost friends?
Guess that depends
Take some benefit
With all your doubt
If this is principle
I'm dropping out

You demonize
You don't look so bad
You wouldn't take
What you couldn't have
My back is warm
With your friendly fire
I know you're trying
Could you please aim it higher?
Could you please aim it higher?

So alone, I wrote
I wrote this will
I will decline
This fish ain't big
This pond is small
So small of mind

Down at the liquor store
Beneath the neon sky
Our moonlight
Six A.M., the floor comes alive with lice
The pan's dried up so tight
With hardened beans
We're hungry
So I lean on you sometimes
Just to see you're still there
Your feet can't take the weight of one
Much less two
We hit concrete
How were we born into this mess?
I know I painted you a prettier picture, baby
We were run out on a rail
Fell from the wagon to the night train
I kissed the bottle
I should've been kissing you
You wake up to an empty night
With tears for two
Cigarettes, they fill the gaps
In our empty days
In our broken teeth
We're jonesing
Say mister, can you spare a dime?
Some change could make a change
Could buy some time
Some freedom
Or an ear to hear my story
It's all I've got
My fiction beats the hell out of my truth
A palm upturned burnt blue
Don't call it sunburn
You've been shaking on the job
Just one drink ahead of your past
There's a white light coming up
You draw the blinds, hoping it'll pass
I kissed the bottle
I should've been kissing you
You wake up to an empty night
With tears for two
I kissed the bottle
I should've been kissing you
You wake up to an empty night

I drove myself insane
No small getaway
Asleep with both hands on the wheel
White knuckle weekend
Chewing ephedrine
Going to an unnamed end
(Unending)

We met in rain
You asked me in
Seemed like a good sign
Now I need a guillotine
To get you off my mind
I brush my teeth until they break
Until I start bleeding
So when I smile, I'll know
I'm almost good enough for you
(And would you...)

Follow me to the end of the dare
Raise your eyes, return the stare
Become your words
Your words, so becoming
On any Sunday, I'll be there

I tried to drink you off my mind
I just got wasted
It only made the pain that much more acute
(But cute)
Isn't strong enough a word
Unintentionally gorgeous
An accidental charm
A graceful drinking arm

Follow me to the end of the dare
Raise your eyes, return the stare
Become your words

Soapy hands fumbling on porcelain
Hot, good coffee and a good, good book
Bicycle, bicycle

Breathing easier now
Tear the roof off your day
No one's coming over
It ain't written
So don't try to read it

Smell the hot rain on the street
Could be love, could be alcohol
Cup my hands around your face
A little frame, a lot of pain
I can tell the tears from the rain
One tastes sweet, the other plain

Breathing easier now
Tear the roof off your day
No one's coming over
It ain't written
So don't try to read it

And who am I to think I could hang
Such a precious life on a clever line?
You're in all the books I read
A hundred pages out of reach
And so I pull myself
Crawl to feet, hit the street
It'll take some time
To learn the lesson of the fall
And begin another climb

Tear the roof off your day
No one's coming over
It ain't written
So don't try to read it"

You'll sleep alone
Getting everything you wanted
Getting everything you wanted and some
Here's the kitchen, cook alone
Look at the water boil
At the table, sit and stare
Soup with bread with so much to care for...

All my friends back east keep asking
""What have you done with your life?""
Just a little too strung out to lie

Suddenly, it seems so clear
Rejecting what you can't have
Light a candle, smoke and pray
All good sins will find you, one day
Now another month is gone
Soon, it will be a year
Go to bed and say out loud
""Is it over where it's all gone wrong?""

All my friends back east keep asking
""What have you done with your life?""
Just a little too strung out to lie

My ambition keeps getting in the way
When I found my voice, there's nothing left to say
Inhibition keeps me behind this door
My life's a running joke
What am I?
What am I running for?"

Memory collecting before his time

I see a tear welling up in his eye
No, you can't cheat time
Don't let that control your life
Hold your breath, close your eyes
Just jump in, the water's fine
These pleas, fall on deaf ears
Ears that were once tuned to truth
A dated, washed up, old man
Has seen it all, nothing else for him to do
No, you can't cheat time
Don't let that control your life
Goes over your head, look over your shoulder
When you look back you're that much older
(It slips away)
Be what you're becoming
(It slips away)
And not who you were
(It slips away)
Grab hold of the here and now while you still have the chance
So are you giving up now?
As for adventures you've had your fill
Who says you're over the hill?
I think it was you, and you know very well
No, you can't cheat time

When will you trust yourself?

Away into the night
Storm rolling in
The darkness descending and then
She picks up her poison bottle
Cloudy sky, cloudy mind, now she feels at home
She drinks away her pain
As she takes your life into her hands
Out on the road
The poison has begun to settle in
She's going home
But wishes she could disappear again
She starts to swerve
The white line means nothing to her
She picks up her poison bottle
Heavy head, heavy eyes, will she make it home?
She drinks away her pain
As she takes your life into her hands
Her memories remain
As she takes your life into her hands
Losing control
Bits and pieces scatter like small toys
She'll never know
The lives she has taken and destroyed
She looks around
At flames eating bodies on the ground
She sees her broken poison bottle
Pick it up, smash it down in a pool of blood
The cops came and they took her away in chains"

Who is a foe, who's a friend, and who pretends
For his or her own benefit and all the while I know

If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they fall, they would fall (fall)

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complaining
Always complaining
If money is such a problem
Well they got mansions, think we should rob them

Well did you know when you were famous you could kill your wife
And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash, to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were smoking crack
McDonald's wouldn't even want to take you back
You could always just run for mayor of D.C

I'd like to see them spend a week, living life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they fall, they would fall

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complaining
Always complaining
If money is such a problem
Well they got mansions, think we should rob them (rob them, rob them)


They would fall (fall)
Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complaining
Always complaining
If money is such a problem
You got so many problems, I think I can solve them

Lifestyles of the rich and famous
We'll take your clothes, cash, cars, and homes, just stop complaining
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Lifestyles of the rich and famous"

I'm writing to you
Not to tell you that I still hate you
Just to ask you how you feel
And how we fell apart
How this fell apart

Are you happy out there in this great wide world?
Do you think about your sons?
Do you miss your little girl?
When you lay your head down
How do you sleep at night?
Do you even wonder if we're alright?
If we're alright
We're alright
We're alright

It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
You broke my mother's heart
You broke your children for life
It's not okay, but we're alright
I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
But those are just a long lost memory of mine
I spent so many years learning how to survive
And I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive

The days I spent so cold, so hungry
Were full of hate, I was so angry
The scars run deep inside this tattooed body
There's things I'll take to my grave
But I'm okay
I'm okay

It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
You broke my mother's heart
You broke your children for life
It's not okay, but we're alright
I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
But those are just a long lost memory of mine
I spent so many years learning how to survive
And I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive

Sometimes I forgive
Yeah, and this time, I'll admit
That I miss you, said I miss you

It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
You broke my mother's heart

Good Charlotte,Movin' On,The Young and the Hopeless,10/01/2002,"When I think about my life I wonder
If I will survive to live to see 25 or will I just fall
Like all my friends they just keep dying
People 'round me always crying in this place that I like to call my home

But not everybody knows that everybody goes to a better place
And not everybody knows that everybody could be living their last days

But the hard time will come and will keep moving on we're moving on
Keep moving on!
Life! Hope! Truth! Trust!
Faith! Pride! Love! Lust!
On without the things we've lost; the things we've gained, we'll take with us

And alls I've got are these two hands to make myself a better man
I wonder if I will ever see the end of this
With all this rain it just keeps falling
On my head and now I'm calling
Out to someone else to help me make it through

But not everybody knows that everybody goes to a better place
And not everybody knows that everybody could be living their last days

But the hard times will come and will keep moving on, we're moving on
Keep moving on!
Life! Hope! Truth! Trust!
Faith! Pride! Love! Lust!
Pain! Hate! Lies! Guilt!
Laugh! Cry! Live! Die!
Some friends become enemies, some friends become your family
Make the best with what you're given; this ain't dying, this is living

So you're moving on and you've got nothing to prove to anyone
But you'll get through, we're moving on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on and on an and on and on

Keep moving on!
Life! Hope! Truth! Trust!
Faith! Pride! Love! Lust!
Pain! Hate! Lies! Guilt!
Laugh! Cry! Live! Die!
Some friends become enemies, some friends become your family
Make the best with what you're given; this ain't dying, this is living"

His throat
And called you on the telephone
To take off
My disguise

You mourn the death of your bloody valentine

You mourn the death of your bloody valentine

Police and
Flashing lights
The rain came down so hard that night and the
Headlines read
A lover died
No tell-tale heart was left to find when you...

You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
The night he died
You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
One last time
Singing

He dropped you off, I followed him home
Then I, I stood outside his bedroom window
Standing over him, he begged me not to do
What I knew I had to do because I'm so in love with you

Oh, my love

I'll wash my bloody hands and
We'll start a new life

When will you laugh again

We'd make noise until 3 am
And the neighbors would complain

I woke up knowing
Today is the day I will die
Ca$hdogg was barking
Went to the park
And enjoyed it one last time
I called my mother
Told her I loved her
And I begged her not to cry
I wrote a letter
I said I'd miss her
And I signed that good bye

You know the happiest day of my life
I swear the happiest day of my life
Is the day that I die

Can you feel the cold tonight? (the day that I died)
It sets in, but it's alright (the day that I died)
Darkness falls, I'm letting go (the day that I died)
All alone, but I feel fine (the day that I died)

We took a drive and
We drove through DC
To see the places we lived
Long conversations
We talked of old friends
And all the things that we did
The summer nights
Drunken fights
Mistakes we made
Did we live it right?

You know the happiest day of my life
I swear the happiest day of my life
Is the day that I die

Can you feel the cold tonight? (the day that I died)
It sets in, but it's alright (the day that I died)

Doing himself in

This is the story of my old man
Just like his father before him
I'm telling you
Do anything you can
So you don't end up just like them
Like them

Monday he woke up and hated life
Drank until Wednesday and left his wife
Thursday through Saturday lost everything
Woke up on Sunday miserable again

I remember baseball games
And working on the car
He told that he loved me
And that I would go far
Showed me how to work hard and
Stick up for myself
I wish he wasn't too hard
To listen to himself

This is the story of my old man
Just like his father before him
I'm telling you
Do anything you can
So you don't end up just like them

Forget what we know, it's just a big show
What they want to control
So jaded, frustrated, it's all so complicated
Fashion no passion surrounds me

All I know is I've heard this all before, reality's a bore
You ask me to believe in something fake
Well I, can't bring myself to do what you want me to
This is who we are and nothing's going to change
Nothing's going to change

I can't take part in the businessman illusion
I'll take my chance in the real world confusion
Don't blame us, who do we trust
When they're so dishonest
No patience, this nation's obsessed with exploitation
Lying denying surrounds me

All I know is I've heard this all before, reality's a bore
You ask me to believe in something fake
Well I, can't bring myself to do what you want me to
This is who we are and nothing's going to change

Don't think you can ignore us
Don't tell me that we're to blame
Don't pick our future for us
Or act like we're the same

All I know is I've heard this all before, reality's a bore
You ask me to believe in something fake
Well I, can't bring myself to do what you want me to
This is who we are and nothing's going to change

Thanks for nothing
(I've heard this all before)
Thanks for nothing
(reality's a bore)
Thanks for nothing
(i'll never be the same)
Thanks for nothing
(and nothing's gonna change)"
NOFX,13 Stitches,The War on Errorism,01/01/2003,"The first time I saw The Descendents
They were the fastest band I'd ever seen
No one in the crowd really cared for them
We were waiting for The Alley Cats to play
After a couple months I heard Kabuki Girl
On Rodney on the ROQ late Sunday night
That was enough for me, I hopped the bus
To Licorice Pizza and bought my all time favorite record
The next time I went to The Whisky
It was D.O.A. with Millions of Dead Cops
The latter band played faster than I could believe
But the songs sounded the same and kinda sucked
Said John Wayne was a Nazi
And Joey Shithead was a drunk
Then John Macias beat some hippie to a pulp
Cause having long hair was a mistake
The third time I went to the hospital
I needed 13 stitches in my head
I managed to catch about 6 songs of Ill Repute
Then some suicidal threw me into a post
My girlfriend started to cry cause we had to leave
Before DRI played 50 lousy songs
My blood stained shirt smelled of clove cigarettes
But it sure looked pretty cool after a wash"
AFI,Girl's Not Grey,Sing the Sorrow,01/12/2003,"I'll lay me down tonight
Much further down
Swim in the calm tonight
This art does drown

(What follows) me as the whitest lace of light
(Will swallow whole) just begs to be imbrued
(What follows) has led me to this place
Where I belong, with all erased
What follows

All insects sing tonight
The coldest sound
I'd send God's grace tonight
Could it be found?

(What follows) me as the whitest lace of light
(Will swallow whole) just begs to be imbrued
(What follows) has led me to this place
Where I belong, with all erased

I'll lay me down tonight
Much further down
Watch stars go out tonight
On sinking ground
I'll lay me down, I'll lay me down

Where I belong, with all erased

Sum 41,The Hell Song,Does This Look Infected?,02/01/2003,"Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same things to you
It's just a matter how you solve them
And knowing how to change the things you've been through
I feel I've come to realize
How fast life can be compromised
Step back to see what's going on
I can't believe this happened to you
(This happened to you)

It's just a problem that I'm faced with; am I
Not the only one who hates to stand by?
Complications that are first in this line
With all these pictures running through my mind
Knowing endless consequences
I feel so useless in this
Get back, step back, and as for me
I can't believe

Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure anymore

Everybody's got their problems

Never end up being what we chose

Good Charlotte,The Anthem,The Young and the Hopeless,02/28/2003,"Yeah
Here we go

It's a new day but it all feels old
""It's a good life"" ' that's what I'm told
But every day, it all just feels the same
At my high school it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there ' it only made me see
That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna to hear the words you say and...

I don't ever wanna' I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

""Go to college or university
Get a real job"" ' that's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm going to get by and just do my time
Outta step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat so pay no mind
Do you really wanna be like them?
Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd? 'Cause...

I don't ever wanna' I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

Shake it once, that's fine
Shake it twice, that's okay
Shake it three times
You're playing with your self again
(You, don't wanna be just like you)
What I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Now you can feel me, sing if you're with me
You, don't wanna be just like you

This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Now you can feel me, sing if you're with me

The Ataris,All You Can Ever Learn Is What You Already Know,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"Is this how it was intended?
The sunrise over smokestacks in the Midwest
The beauty of this abandoned factory
Christmas lights blinking on and off all
Out of time in what used to be
Your pink house dreams of a middle class America
I'm trying to believe in you, but all these satellites
And shattered dreams are blocking out my view
Please don't forget who you really are
'Cause nothing really matters when we're gone
Fell in love with his keno waitress
They honeymooned in Memphis
They were married by the drive-up window
Trailer parks, neon signs, and an empty box of Lucky Strikes
All used up on the dashboard of America
I'm trying to believe in you but
This world sold its faith for parking lots and drunk sincerity
Please don't forget who you really are
'Cause nothing really matters when we're
You'll be saddened to know, the train tracks
You once walked as a young boy
Are now nothing but a graveyard
Please don't forget how small we really are
Nothing really matters when we're gone
Nothing really matters
I'm trying to believe in you"
The Ataris,Eight of Nine,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"These hospital walls are the palest of white
Here in this desert they're reciting my last rights
The smell of these halls brings temporary comfort
As oxygen flows through my blood
El Corazon was poisoned tonight
She's on her eight of nine
When half of all your prayers are insincere
The other half are lies
Here is this watermark under this bridge
The point where it crested
Rolled back and drifted into the sea
I climb from this wreckage
As the smoke begins to clear from my lungs
The closest of close calls has happened tonight
It's time that I made things right
For the first time since the last time
Let this moment of clarity
Lift this curse that has been cast upon me
So appreciate the good times
But don't take the worst for granted
Because you only get so many second chances"
The Ataris,In This Diary,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"Here in this diary
I write you visions of my summer
It was the best I ever had
There were choruses and sing-alongs
And that unspoken feeling
Of knowing that right now is all that matters
All the nights we stayed up talking
Listening to '80s songs
And quoting lines from all those movies that we love
It still brings a smile to my face
I guess when it comes down to it
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right
Breaking into hotel swimming pools
And wreaking havoc on our world
Hanging out at truck stops just to pass the time
The blacktop singing me to sleep
Lighting fireworks in parking lots
Illuminate the blackest nights
Cherry cokes under this moonlit summer sky
2015 Riverside, it's time to say goodbye
Get on the bus, it's time to go
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right
(Get it right)
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right"
The Ataris,Looking Back on Today,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"30th of April
Seems like yesterday
Bought a house above the ocean
Where our kids could laugh and play
I called you from Paris
To tell you that I
Wrote our names on the observation deck
Of the Eiffel Tower
Remember those nights
Playing ""Summer Wind"" on the jukebox of the bar we used to go
We made out in the bathroom and you walked me to my house
I tried to convince you not to go home
If only I had more time
I'd take you where you wanted to go
Italy isn't the same without you here
If only I had one wish
I'd want a million trillion life times that I could spend with you
I'd fall in love with you again and again
First of November
1998
I was thinking of what to say
When I would call
Denise come over to my house
Cause you're the one for me
We'll drink cheap wine
And watch for shooting stars
Remember our first apartment?
Our couch was never big enough for two
Still we'd fall asleep in each other's arms
And wake up on the floor
Now, looking back, it was made for me and you
If only I had more time
I'd take you where you wanted to go
Japan is really nice this time of year
If only I had one wish
I'd want a million trillion lifetimes that I could spend with you
I'd fall in love with you again and again"
The Ataris,My Reply,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"I got your letter
And the poetry you sent me
Postmarked in December of last year
I really hope you're doing better
All your friends close by your side
One step closer to recovery
I wish there was something I could say
To erase each and every page you've been through
Even though it's not my place to save you
I appreciate but can't accept this thank you note
That's sealed with your last breath
And I won't stand aside and listen to you give up
If you'll just hold on for one more second
If you just hold on to what you have
Just hold on, just hold on
You will wake up tomorrow
If you'll just hold on for one more second
If you just hold on to what you have
Just hold on, just hold on
You will wake up tomorrow
These arms remain stretched out to you
Maybe someday you'll accept them
Maybe it's too late to save
A young girl's heart that's long stopped beating
Wake up, wake up, you've gotta believe
Wake up, wake up, you can't give up
Time keeps going on without us
Long after we're dead and gone
I wish there was something I could say
To erase each and every page you've been through
Even though it's not my place to save you
I appreciate but can't accept this thank you note
That's sealed with your last breath
And I won't stand aside and listen to you give up
If you'll just hold on for one more second
Just hold on to what you have
If you just hold on, just hold on
If you'll just hold on for one more second
Just hold on to what you have
If you just hold on, just hold on"
The Ataris,Radio #2,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"Meet me at midnight, the broadcast tower
High above the hollywood sign
You bring your guitar and I'll bring my radio, radio
Everyone look up for miles around
To witness this beautiful sight
We'll set bonfires, pretend it's the Fourth of July
This is the starting of a brand new revolution
Bite the hand that feeds
Stand up and fight against the messages that they're sending
Stop their frequency
You're always talking, it's neverending
It's about time that we turned off the radio
Call the request lines and tell them that it's over
You're always playing all of the same songs
Over and over again
It's about time that we all turned off the radio
We'll listen to b-sides and sing along
To anthems of the years gone by
Integrity and honesty will prevail tonight
When it's all over, one question still remains
Why do so many bands never make it to the radio?
This is the starting of a brand new revolution
Bite the hand that feeds
Stand up and fight against the messages that they're sending
Stop their frequency
You're always talking, it's neverending
It's about time that we turned off the radio
Call the request lines and tell them that it's over
You're always playing all of the same songs
Over and over again
It's about time that we all turned off the radio
Look outside your FM dial they're preaching lies in 4/4 time
Our generation without a voice is stripped of pride
You're always talking, it's neverending
It's about time that we turned off the radio
Call the request lines and tell them that it's over
You're always playing all of the same songs
Over and over again
It's about time that we all turned off the radio
You're always talking
It's about time that we all turned off the radio
You're always playing all of the same songs
It's about time that we all turned off the radio"
The Ataris,"So Long, Astoria","So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"It was the first snow of the season
I can almost see you breathing
In the middle of that empty street
Sometimes I still see myself
In that lonesome bedroom
Playing my guitar and singing
Songs of hope for a better future
Life is only as good as the memories we make
And I'm taking back what belongs to me
Polaroids of classrooms unattended
These relics of remembrance are just like shipwrecks
Only they're gone faster than the smell after it rains
Last night while everyone was sleeping
I drove through my old neighborhood
And resurrected memories from ashes
We said that we would never fit in
When we were really just like them
Does rebellion ever make a difference?
Life is only as good as the memories we make
And I'm taking back what belongs to me
Polaroids of classrooms unattended
These relics of remembrance are just like shipwrecks
Only they're gone faster than the smell after it rains
So long, Astoria
I found a map to buried treasure
And even if we come home empty handed
We'll still have our stories of battle scars
Pirate ships and wounded hearts
Broken bones and all the best of friendships
And when this hourglass has filtered out
Its final grain of sand
I raise my glass to the memories we had
This is my wish and I'm taking it back
I'm taking them all back"
The Ataris,Summer '79,"So Long, Astoria",03/04/2003,"Our last day of summer
1979
We gotta live up one time before it's over
We will make history tonight
Out at the drive-in
All of our closest friends will be sneaking in
You'll be spending your whole night
Trying everything you can to get that girl to notice you
We Are the Champions
Playing loud on the radio station
Everyone sing along
With these anthems of our generation
Cruising down Pacific Coast Highway
Put the top down, crawl into the back seat
Let's create anthems of our own tonight
Down at the roller rink
All the cool kids crowding around the air hockey table
Hey, my best friend likes you
I hear you shout at me as you go skating by
We Are the Champions
Playing loud on the radio station
Everyone sing along with these anthems of our generation
Cruisin down Pacific Coast Highway
Put the top down, crawl into the back seat
Let's create anthems of our own tonight
Sneak out of the window, darling
Let's live like outlaws, honey
We'll never look back
Climb out on this rooftop
And stare at the city lights below us
This world belongs to us tonight
The kids will keep raging on and they ain't ever gonna stop
We Are the Champions
Playing loud on the radio station
Everyone sing along with these anthems of our generation
Cruisin down Pacific Coast Highway
Put the top down, crawl into the back seat
Let's create anthems of our own tonight"

We'll drive out past the runway
And watch the planes go flying by
The runway lights are the deepest blue
Like the colors of your eyes
So close them tight and kiss me one last time

If you could go anywhere right now, where would you go
And would you miss me when you get there
There's no place that I would rather be

Please don't let me, go falling from the sky
This fasten seatbelt sign just needs to go out
If only you could be, right here by my side
Home wouldn't seem so far from here

Passport, customs, carry-on, remember
To shut off all of your, electronic devices
Fell asleep on Tuesday, woke up Monday afternoon
I slept right through your international dateline

If you could go anywhere right now
Where would you go
And would you miss me when you get there
There's no place that I would rather be

Please don't let me, go falling from the sky
This fasten seat belt sign just needs to go out

Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not at home

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
I don't understand what happened to our love
But baby when I get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today
I saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
""Don't look back. You can never look back.""
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone"

Apartment 108
I'll always keep you in my heart
Anderson is cold tonight
The leaves are scattered on the ground
I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile
Sometimes this song feels like a dream
I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds
I remember how our family split apart
I don't think I ever told you
But I know you always did your best
In the hard times that only made us stronger
As I sit here all alone
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone
I'll never be the same without you
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know
Sometimes we're helpless and alone
But you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on
Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
And say this prayer for you tonight
Because nothing is impossible
As I sit here all alone
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone
I'll never be the same without you
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know
Sometimes we're helpless and alone
But you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on
The hardest part isn't finding what we need to be
It's being content with who we are
Stay who you are
Stay who you are
Stay who you are
Stay who you are
Stay who you are"

I can hear the church bells calling out my name
This table is set for one
Even angels would be homesick in this forsaken town
On random notes of parchment
I'm scrawling my existence
Dressed in white
This candle radiates throughout the night
And it's never burning out
Never burning out
From this second story window
I can hear the children down on Main Street
They're singing their songs tonight
In the shadows, I will listen to their every movement
Mr. Higginson, am I not good enough for the world?
Am I destined only to die the same way that I lived
In seclusion?
From high up on this mountain
I can almost see your lonely windowsill
They'll carry you off tonight
There's a ghost in your old bedroom
And a candle burning bright
If I died tomorrow
Would this song live on forever?"

I crumble, I cannot, I cannot find reflection in these days

(Listen close) Beat by beat
(You can hear when the heart stops) I saved the pieces
(When it broke) And ground them all to dust

I am destroyed by the inside, I disassociate
I hope to destroy the outside, it will alleviate and elevate me

Like water flowing into lungs, I'm flowing through these days
Like morphine cuts through, through dead end veins, I'm numbing in these days
So...

AFI,...But Home is Nowhere,Sing the Sorrow,03/11/2003,"Twenty-six years and seems like I've just begun
To understand my, my intimate is no one
When the director sold the show, who bought its last rites?
They cut the cast, the music, and the lights

This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time, left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone

Twenty-six years end, still speaking in these tongues
Such revelations, while understood by no one
When the new actor stole the show, who questioned his grace?
Please clear this house of ill-acquired taste

This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time and left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone

Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something real

I lay strewn across the floor, can't solve this puzzle
Everyday, another small piece can't be found
I lay strewn across the floor, pieced up in sorrow
The pieces are lost, these pieces don't fit
Pieced together incomplete and empty

This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural

Let me hide within your black, the still inside your eyes
Deafened, caught within a cry
So sensual, as step by step by step, I separate
As breath to breath, I suffocate

(Oh, we dance in misery)
All lost in the arms of our misery, oh
(Oh, we dance in misery)
And we dance on, and we dance on
Swept off our feet by misery, we're swept into the shadows

So who will follow?
Who is the lead?
I know I'll leave a stain, because I bleed
As we dance, we all dance
We all have no chance in this horrid romance

To leave this dead space with hatred, so alive

Writhing with sickness, thrown into banality, I decay
Killed by the weakness, but forced to return, turn it off

I watch the stars as they fall from the sky
I held a fallen star and it wept for me, dying
I feel the fallen stars encircle me, now as they cry

Out there, so quickly, grows malignant tribes
Post-human extinction excels, unrecognized

Feeling surrounded, so bored with mortality, I decay
All of this hatred is fucking real, turn it on, yeah

I watch the stars as they fall from the sky
I held a fallen star and it wept for me, dying
I feel the fallen stars encircle me, now as they cry

It won't be all right, despite what they say
Just watch the stars tonight as they, as they disappear, disintegrate
And I disintegrate 'cause this hate is fucking real
And I hope to shade the world as stars go out and I disintegrate"

You're going out, going out, forever unknown
These waves of plastic fame go out of fashion

You're going out, going out
(Because you're dying to become forever unknown, unknown)

From above, a rain of ashes descends
Like anathema, I will remain, forever will remain
From below, in my seclusion
Look up to the sky to see paper wings and watch them burn

Without habitation, you'll never find a soul inside
No life, but nothing's died
No lights, but quite the show
Just as long as no one ever knows
All motion is pantomime

You're going out, going out, forever unknown

Dancing in the rain of descending ash
Dancing on your grave, I'll see you all falling
Dancing in the rain of descending ash
Dancing in your dust, I'll see you all falling

I'd stop it, had you a heart (your heart)
I'd stop it, had you a heart (your heart)

Chrysanthemums of white, they seemed so beautiful
I can remember, I searched for the amaranth
I'd shut my eyes to see

Oh, how I smiled then, so near the cherished ones
I knew they would appear, saw not a single one
Oh, how I smiled then, waiting so patiently
I'd make a wish and bleed

While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away

I can remember, dreamt them so vividly
Soft creatures draped in white, light kisses gracing me
I can remember when I first realized
Dreams were the only place to see them

While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away
Hope was wasting away
Faith was wasting away
I was wasting away

I never, never wanted this
I always wanted to believe
I never, never wanted this
How could I have become?
I never, never wanted this
But from the start, I'd been deceived
I never, never wanted this
How could I have become?
I never, never wanted this
I always wanted to believe
I never, never wanted this
I never, never wanted this
But from the start, I'd been deceived
I never, never wanted this

Inside a crumbling effigy
But you promised
So dies all innocence
But you promised me

While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away
While I waited, I was wasting away
Hope was wasting away
Faith was wasting away

""Poisoned hearts will never change,"" walked away again

Felt the chill upon my face, cooling from within

Hard to notice gleaming from the sky
When you're staring at the cracks
Hard to notice what is passing by with eyes lowered
You walked away, heard them say
""Poisoned hearts will never change,"" walked away again

All the cracks, they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me
All the cracks, they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me, and I fell apart

Or were you sent to save me?
I've thought too much, you won't find anything
Worthy of redeeming

Yo he estado aqu' muchas veces antes y regres'

To break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away

Imperfect cry, and scream in ecstasy
So what befalls the flawless?
Look what I've built (please don't do this)
It shines so beautifully (why won't you look at me)
Now watch as it destroys me

Y regreso aqu' otra vez y comienzo

To break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away
Break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away

I left it all behind, and never said goodbye
I left it all behind, and never said goodbye
I left it all behind, and never said goodbye
I left it all to die
I saw its birth, I watched it grow
I felt it change me
I took the life, I ate it slow
Now it consumes me

Break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away
Break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away
Heart away"
AFI,The Spoken Word,Sing the Sorrow,03/11/2003,"We held hands on the last night of earth. Our mouths filled with dust, we kissed in the fields and under trees, screaming like dogs, bleeding dark into the leaves. It was empty on the edge of town but we knew everyone floated along the bottom of the river. So we walked through the waste where the road curved into the sea and the shattered seasons lay, and the bitter smell of burning was on you like a disease. In our cancer of passion you said, ""Death is a midnight runner.""
The sky had come crashing down like the news of an intimate suicide. We picked up the shards and formed them into shapes of stars that wore like an antique wedding dress. The echoes of the past broke the hearts of the unborn as the Ferris wheel silently slowed to a stop. The few insects skittered away in hopes of a better pastime. I kissed you at the apex of the maelstrom and asked if you would accompany me in a quick fall, but you made me realize that my ticket wasn't good for two. I rode alone
You said, ""The cinders are falling like snow."" There is poetry in despair, and we sang with unrivaled beauty, bitter elegies of savagery and eloquence. Of blue and grey. Strange, we ran down desperate streets and carved our names in the flesh of the city. The sun has stagnated somewhere beyond the rim of the horizon and the darkness is a mystery of curves and lines. Still, we lay under the emptiness and drifted slowly outward, and somewhere in the middle in the wilderness we found salvation scratched into the earth like a message"
AFI,This Celluloid Dream,Sing the Sorrow,03/11/2003,"Calling tears from deep inside, oh, you're so exquisite
And in the mirror, all midnight eyes
Oh, if I could remain, but it's just a visit
All midnight eyes, read ""vacancy""
Twisted, twisting

To the lovely dancing lights, I begged, ""May I cut in?""
But they never stopped playing their song
Of a joyous song they sing, I've heard whispers
On a freezing note, I resonate

Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Just like a memory, it twists me
Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Twist, twisting me

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
On to the melting boy, and melt away
You light as gently, you're so cinematic
Bathed in your radiance, I melt

In the glitter, in the dark, sunk into velvet
Praying this will never end
In the shadow of a star, in static pallor
I realized I never began

Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Just like a memory, it twists me
Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Twist, twisting me

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
On to the melting boy, and melt away
You light as gently, you're so cinematic
Bathed in your radiance, I melt

All the colors, upon leaving, all will turn to grey
All the colors, upon leaving, all will turn to grey
(All grey) all the colors (all grey) upon leaving
(All grey) all will turn to grey
(All grey) all the colors (all grey) upon leaving
(All grey) all will turn to grey, grey
Twisting me

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
On to the melting boy, and melt away
You light as gently, you're so cinematic
Bathed in your radiance

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
You land as lightly as the new snow, and melt away
You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
Bathed in your radiance, I melt"

Forever haunted, more than afraid
Asphyxiate on words I would say
I'm drawn to a blackened sky as I turn blue

There are no flowers, no, not this time
There'll be no angels gracing the lines
Just these stark words, I find
I'd show a smile, but I'm too weak
I'd share with you, could I only speak
Just how much this hurts me

I cannot stay here, I cannot leave
Just like all I loved, I'm make believe
Imagine heart, I disappear
Seems no one will appear here and make me real

There are no flowers, no, not this time
There'll be no angels gracing the lines
Just these stark words, I find
I'd show a smile, but I'm too weak
I'd share with you, could I only speak
Just how much this hurts me

I'd tell you how it haunts me
I'd tell you how it haunts me

I'd tell you how it haunts me
(Cuts through my days, and sinks into my dreams)
You don't care that it haunts me

There are no flowers, no, not this time

NOFX,Re-Gaining Unconsciousness,The War on Errorism,03/25/2003,"First they put away the dealers
Keep our kids safe and off the streets
Then they put away the prostitutes
Keep married men cloistered at home
Then they shooed away the bums
Then they beat and bashed the queers
Turned away asylum-seekers
Fed us suspicions and fears
We didn't raise our voice
We didn't make a fuss
It's funny there was no one left to notice
When they came for us
Looks like witches are in season
You better fly your flag and be aware
Of anyone who might fit the description
Diversity is now our biggest fear
Now with our conversations tapped
And our differences exposed
How ya supposed to love your neighbor
With our minds and curtains closed?
We used to worry 'bout big brother
Now we got a big father and an even bigot mother
And still you believe
This aristocracy gives a fuck about you
They put the mock in demockracy
And you swallowed every hook
The sad truth is you would rather
Follow the school into the net
Cause swimming alone at sea
Is not the kind of freedom you actually want
So go back to your crib and suck on a tit
Go bask in the warmth of your diaper
You're sitting in shit and piss
While sucking a giant pacifier
A country of adult infants
A legion of mental midgets
All regaining their unconsciousness"

It's simply pathetic if I call you anymore
I can't figure it now
We tallied our scores
I got knocked out
I know when you come to town
I know where you drop your dime and whom it's for
I'm not good enough to time your cup of coffee 15 years... was long enough
Look at me
I'm an old colleague
Another hard knocks day acquaintance
Finally you are free of me
It must be true or you'd give a minute
But it's always my fault
Always it's your forgiveness
This unbalanced resolve
I must be hateful
So I hang up the phone
Call it a small sacrifice
You still hear me now
Dear you, the vinyl it was blue
Stalking poor Blake commiserating drunks at sea
Do you remember when Jawbreaker rocked ""The boat""?
I'm sure you do...and don't
Look at me
I'm an old fly buddy
Just a blue coach class acquaintance
Finally you are free of me
It must be true 'cause it only makes sense
I can still see you now
Pictures are in every town
I can still write it down ""I must be hateful""
I can hang up the phone
Even at those lofty heights
You still hear me now"

Why think of all the bad things when life is so good?
Why help with an 'am' when there's always a 'could'?
Let the whales worry about the poisons in the sea
Outside of California, it's foreign policy
I don't want changes, I have no reactions
Your dilemmas are my distractions

That's no way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco, Franco Un-American

I never looked around, never second-guessed
Then I read some Howard Zinn now I'm always depressed
And now I can't sleep from years of apathy
All because I read a little Noam Chomsky
I'm eating vegetation, cause of Fast Food Nation
I'm wearing uncomfortable shoes cause of globalization
I'm watching Michael Moore expose the awful truth
I'm listening to Public Enemy and Reagan Youth
I see no world peace cause of zealous armed forces
I eat no breath-mints cause they're from de-hoofed horses

Now the idiots have taken over
Spreading like a social cancer, is there an answer?
Mensa membership conceding
Tell me why and how are all the stupid people breeding
Watson, it's really elementary
The industrial revolution
Has flipped the bitch on evolution
The benevolent and wise are being thwarted, ostracized, what a bummer
The world keeps getting dumber
Insensitivity is standard and faith is being fancied over reason
Darwin's rolling over in his coffin
The fittest are surviving much less often
Now everything seems to be reversing, and it's worsening
Someone flopped a steamer in the gene pool
Now angry mob mentality's no longer the exception, it's the rule
And I'm starting to feel a lot like Charlton Heston
Stranded on a primate planet
Apes and orangutans that ran it to the ground
With generals and the armies that obeyed them
Followers following fables
Philosophies that enable them to rule without regard
There's no point for democracy when ignorance is celebrated
Political scientists get the same one vote as some Arkansas inbred
Majority rule, don't work in mental institutions
Sometimes the smallest softest voice carries the grand biggest solutions
What are we left with?
A nation of god-fearing pregnant nationalists
Who feel it's their duty to populate the homeland
Pass on traditions
How to get ahead religions
And prosperity via simpleton culture

Now want their fries and coke
Cursing and birds are not allowed
In fact let's keep noise levels down

Why don't we put pads on the kids?
Helmets, head gear and mouth pieces!
Then we could pad the floors and walls
Put cameras inside bathroom stalls
We make sure only nice bands play
Make every show a matinee
Teach kids to be all they can be
And we could sing my country tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
When did punk rock become so safe?
I know it wasn't Duane or Fletcher
Who put up the barricades
Like a stake in the heart
Somehow we got driven apart
I want conflict! I want dissent!
I want the scene to represent
Our hatred of authority
Our fight against complacency
Stop singing songs 'bout girls and love!
You killed the owl! You freed the dove!
Confrontation and politics
Replaced with harmonies and shticks
When did punk rock become so tame?

Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside
When you left that night
It's about time that you got sick of me
No longer fun, and so far from interesting
I thought that I found me a cure for feeling old
Just one more line to keep me sleeping loudly and cold
In disgrace with a shameful regret
As I talk in tongues to myself in my bed
Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside
When you left that night

This bouncing baby boy's now turning baby blue
I've got your pictures on my walls
I've got a long list of calls I must make
To your existing family

Traded true love for insult and injury
We washed it down the drain
With one silver bullet and two Vicodin

Suitcase already packed
Note on the bedstand signed in blood
Sincerely, never coming back

A nightmarish household in which she died
Because it made her feel at home
Somehow made me feel at home
A poinsettia in poison rain

Traded true love for insult and injury

And I wait here, and sometimes I get one
It's nothing I'll forget when the moon gets tired
You are stuck to me everyday
Believe in what I am because it's all I have today
And tomorrow who knows where we'll be
From here I can hardly see a thing
But I will follow anyone who brings me to you
For now, forever, for on and on and on
You know it starts here, outside waiting in the cold
Kiss me once in the snow, I swear it never gets old
And I will promise you I can make it warmer next year
You know I came here when I needed your soft voice
I needed to hear something that sounded like an answer
Now I stay here, and every day I get one
It's nothing I'll forget when the moon gets tired
You are stuck to me everyday
Believe in what I am because it's all I have today
And tomorrow who knows where we'll be
From here I can hardly see a thing
But I will follow anyone who brings me to you
For now, forever, for on and on and on
So go plug in your electric blanket
We can stay in 'till our southern summer wedding day
Go plug in your electric blanket
We can stay here"
Alkaline Trio,This Could Be Love,Good Mourning,05/13/2003,"I've got a book of matches
I've got a can of kerosene
I've got some bad ideas
Involving you and me
I don't blame you for walking away
I touched myself at thoughts of flames
I shat the bed, I laid there in it
Thinking of you, wide awake for days
And I found you tongue-tied
In my twisted little brain
You couldn't crack a smile
I didn't catch your name
I don't blame you for walking away
I'd do the same if I saw me
I swear it's not contagious
In four short steps we can erase this
Step one, slit my throat
Step two, play in my blood
Step three, cover me in dirty sheets
And run laughing out of the house
Step four, stop off at Edgebrook Creek
And rinse your crimson hands
You took me hostage and made your demands
I couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers, one by one
I'm like a broken record
I've got a needle scratching me
It injects the poisons
Of alcohol IV
I don't blame you for walking away
I'd do the same if I saw me
I swear it's not contagious
Swear to God it's not contagious
Step one, slit my throat
Step two, play in my blood
Step three, cover me in dirty sheets
And run laughing out of the house
Step four, stop at Lake Michigan
And rinse your crimson hands
You took me hostage and made your demands
I couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers, one by one
This could be love
Love for fire
This could be love
Love for fire
This could be love
For fire, forever more
Step one, slit my throat
Step two, play in my blood
Step three, cover me in dirty sheets
And run laughing out of the house
Step four stop off at Berkeley Marina
And rinse your crimson hands
You took me hostage and made your demands
I couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers, one by one"
Alkaline Trio,We've Had Enough,Good Mourning,05/20/2003,"In the shadows where the heads hang low
You hear the voices as the wind blows
Asking can't you see?
Reminding you to breathe
It's only time before it catches up
To you and all your broken luck
I've found a better way
To get even with my memory
In the darkness where the angels cry
Give us water, give us back our lives
Our bed's this concrete floor
And it's all we have left to live for
A day we'll never face, we're only
Second-handed, sick, and lonely
Fighting back the tears
And every urge to Van Gogh both our ears
That's it, we've had enough
Please turn that fucking radio off
Ain't nothing on the air wave in the despair we feel
NO!
In the shadows where the heads hang low
You hear the voices as the wind blows
Asking can't you see?

To get even with my enemies
That's it, we've had enough
Please turn that fucking radio off
Ain't nothing on the air wave in the despair we feel
That said, We've had enough
Put ""Walk Among Us"" on and turn it up
Ain't nothing on the air wave in the hatred we feel
NO!
This is our biggest fear
The only tunes that we hear
Come via antenna to your car radio
Oh no, no, no
That's it, we've had enough
We've had enough
That's it, we've had enough
We've had enough"

Yellowcard,Back Home,Ocean Avenue,07/22/2003,"Don't know what I was looking for
When I went home, I found me alone
And sometimes, I need someone to say
""You'll be alright, what's on your mind?""
But the water's shallow here, and I am full of fear
And empty-handed after two long years

Another sunny day in California
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away
Before you get a chance to feel it

Back home, I always thought I wanted so much more
Now I'm not too sure
Cause sometimes I miss knowing someone's there for me
And feeling free
Free to stand beside the ocean in moonlight
And light myself a smoke beneath the dark Atlantic sky

Another sunny day in California
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away
Before you get a chance to feel it

Everybody here is living life in fear of falling out of line
Tearing lives apart and breaking lots of hearts just to pass the time
And the eyes get red in the back of your head, this place will make you blind
Put it all behind me and I'll be just fine

Another sunny day beneath this cloudless sky
Sometimes I wish that it would rain here
And wash away the west coast dreaming from my eyes
There's nothing real for them to see here

Another starry night in California
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away
Before you get a chance
Before you get a chance to feel it"

Think about the heroes saving life in the dark

But you still came back for me
You were strong and you believed

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Be strong, believe
Be strong, believe

Think about the chance I never had to say
Thank you for giving up your life that day
Never fearing, only hearing voices calling out
Let it all go, the life that you know, just to bring it down alive
And you still came back for me
You were strong and you believed

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright

Wanna tell the kids they'll never know how much I love to see them smile
Wanna make a change or two right now
Wanna live a life like you somehow
Wanna make your sacrifice worthwhile

The fan blades on the ceiling spin but the air is never cold
And even though you are next to me I still feel so alone
I just can't give you anything for you to call your own

And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?
My heart's sinking like a weight

Something I've been keeping locked away behind my lips
I can feel it breaking free with each and every kiss
I couldn't bear to hurt you but it's all so different now
Things that I was sure of, they have filled me up with doubt

And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?
My heart's sinking like a weight
I can feel you breathing
It's keeping me awake
Could you stop my heart? It's always beating
Sinking like a weight

How am I supposed to feel about the things I've done?
I don't know if i should stay or turn around and run
I know that I hurt you, things will never be the same
The only love I ever knew, I threw it all away

And I can feel you breathing

You forget where the heart is
Answer ""no"" to these questions
Let her go, learn a lesson
It's not me, you're not listening
Now, can't you see? Something's missing
You forget where the heart is

Take you away
From that empty apartment you stay
And forget where the heart is, someday
If ever you loved me you'd say ""it's okay""

Waking up from this nightmare
How's your life? What's it like there?
Is it all what you want it to be?
Does it hurt when you think about me
And how broken my heart is?


It's okay to be angry and never let go
It only gets harder the more that you know
When you get lonely, if no one's around
You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down
We came together, but you left alone
And I know how it feels to walk out on your own
Maybe some day I will see you again
And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend"

I never wanted it to end this way

Even if i wanted to
I don't think that I'd get to you
There's nothing i can say to you to make you feel alive again

Here. A little jealousy
I hope you think of me
Hope you wonder where i sleep at night (sleep at night)
Cause i feel like I'm inside out
You got me upside down
Maybe i was holding on too tight

Even if i wanted to
I don't think that I'd get to you
There's nothing i can say to you to make you feel alive again
So don't just say goodbye to me
Just turn your back away and leave
And if you're lucky i will be your last regret, your only friend

The two of us we dream like one
The two of us, the two of us
The two of us take breath like one
The two of us, the two of us

I guess that this is over now
I guess it's called the falling out
But everyday i'm learning how to make it through this life i'm in"

I may be leaving but you're always in my heart

Nothing i can do about it, nothing i can say
To bring us back to where we were when life was not this hard (life was not this hard)
Looking back it all just seems so far, so far away

A place that i can share with you

I can tell that you don't know me anymore
It's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget
And being on this road is anything but sure
Maybe we'll forget, i hope we don't forget


So many nights, legs tangled tight
Wrap me up in a dream with you
Close up these eyes, try not to cry
All that i've got to pull me through is memories of you

Won't you sing me to sleep?
And fly through my dreams
So I can hitch a ride with you tonight
And get away from this place
Get a new name and face
I just ain't the same without you in my life

Late night drives
All alone in my car
I can't help but start
Singing lines from all our favorite songs
And melodies in the air
Singing ""Life just ain't fair""
Sometimes I still just can't believe you're gone

And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here

Feel your fire
When it's cold in my heart
And things sorta start
Reminding me of my last night with you
I only need one more day
Just one more chance to say
""I wish that I had gone up with you too""

And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here
You won't be coming back
And I didn't get to say goodbye (goodbye)
I really wish I'd got to say goodbye

And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here

I hope that all is well in heaven
Cause it's all shot to hell down here
I hope that I find you in heaven
Cause I'm so lost without you down here

Wouldn't let me write about
My opinions about the state
And the freedom of expression
They would never tolerate
And the military secrets
I never did steal
I didn't start no violence, no
There was nobody that I killed, no

My only weapon
I call poetry

And liberty I was sworn

Who gets rolled

The Bouncing Souls,Anchors Aweigh,Anchors Aweigh,08/26/2003,"Anchors aweigh, my friends
I'll see you another day
I'm going away
Experiences have to come
And the past has got to go
Back into our dreams
Back into our dreams
Anchors aweigh, my friends
Everybody understands
That good times
That good times come and they go
And together we will always go
Back into our dreams
Back into our dreams
And our troubles, we can't leave them behind
But the wind blows and blows them all away
And the road goes and takes them all away
Back into our dreams"
The Bouncing Souls,I'm From There,Anchors Aweigh,08/26/2003,"When we were two brothers forever through the dark and light
We had our fights against the world, against each other
We traveled in the night
So many roads, so many shows together
Far apart we grew, isolated but still together
When we were two brothers forever through the dark and light
We had our fights against ourselves, against each other
We were afraid, afraid of so many things
It was a fight to overcome ourselves and see clearer
We are two brothers forever through the dark and light
We had our fights against the world, against each other
Time has opened my heart
I don't want to hold on to that past
I don't want to live in isolation anymore
There's nothing left to do, but to kiss that life goodbye
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
We are two brothers forever through the dark and light
We had our fights against ourselves, against each other
There's nothing left to do, but to kiss that life goodbye
Goodbye...
Goodbye...

Leaves fall down around me
They're smashing off my face
Like Orange and Yellow lights
I've entered a new place
I've walked these street 1,000 times before
I never saw them this way
A perfect end and a new beginning
Every step of the way
Colors seem so much more true
My eyes must be on fire
I feel each steps vibration
Stab into my soul
A tornado of light surrounds me
Picks me up off my feet
The world is just a blink of light
It can't hold me anymore"
The Bouncing Souls,Kids And Heroes,Anchors Aweigh,08/26/2003,"Hey, where have you gone?
You used to be the one that we looked up to
It seemed like nothing could break you down
How high was your price and was it worth it?
Nothing in life is a sure bet anyway, you're gone
I guess you weren't here from the start
In the end, it's all a question of heart
Hey, where have you gone?
You used to be the one that we looked up to
It seemed like nothing could break you down
How high was your price and was it worth it?
Nothing in life is a sure bet anyway, you're gone
I guess you weren't here from the start
In the end, it's all a question of heart
Hey, where did it go?
Everything we fought for and everything it meant
Maybe we were just naive, but I still believe
There are only a few things that really belong to me
Who I am, who I was
And who I want to be
Hey, where have I gone?
I used to be the one looking for the hero in some far off place
Blindly ever forward, never knowing all along
The truth was right there in my own song"
The Bouncing Souls,Night Train,Anchors Aweigh,08/26/2003,"Goodbye to me and you, goodbye to the life we knew
One last long embrace, then go and walk on through
I'm leaving everything behind for a peace that I can't find
Ghosts that roam this house, winter air right through our souls
And it feels like dying
It just feels like time to go
Going down south to dream another dream
Maybe check out Memphis, Tennessee
Take the night train with an extra pair of jeans
Can't think of anything else I really need
All my experiences ride with me
This town is dead to me and
I can't stop chasing my dreams
I love you more than anything
But what you want I can never be
I love you more than anything
But I'll be alone, can't we both be free?
Goodbye to me and you
Goodbye to the life we knew
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Then go and walk on through"
The Bouncing Souls,Sing Along Forever,Anchors Aweigh,08/26/2003,"I'm driving, listening to my radio
Checking out the airwaves for something to believe in
Give me something to hold true
Give me something to sing about
Give me a reason to care
I'll sing along forever
Watered-down words covered in song
Trying to hide the truth
That life is beautiful
Or life is pain, give it to me straight
Touch my heart
I'll sing along forever
I'll sing along forever
I'll sing along forever
I'm driving, listening to my radio
Checking out the airwaves for something to believe in

Asleep at the wheel forty miles left to go
Rolling in on fumes to rock the show

We don't need bright lights to spell our name
All we ever wanted was to play

Play it loud, play it loud
Raise your voice, shout it out

We weren't the first but we're holding our own
Ten long years ago the seeds were sown
A song in your heart picks you up when you're down
We like the songs we play we love this sound
We're just like you straight from the crowd

Play it loud, play it loud
Raise your voice, shout it out
Play it loud, play it loud
Raise your voice, shout it out

Hold fast to your friends
Be true to yourself
And stop trying to be just like somebody else

Be yourself

Every time I do
I get shaken inside and the sun in my eyes
I'll stay away
I'd rather be here
Than anywhere with you
Whoo
I'd be dancing with your ghost
Toasting note to note
So here's to the passing
Of all that could be
Between you and me
I'd rather be here
Than anywhere with you
Whoo
I know I can not see you
Even if I wanted to
'cause your light is the light of ten sunsets
Circled by eyes, burned blue and opened wide
I'd rather be here
Than anywhere with you
Whoo
I'd rather be here
Than anywhere with you
Whoo"
Saves the Day,Driving in the Dark,In Reverie,09/16/2003,"Life leaks from your fingertips, onto sparkling pavement
Having heard the news, you stumble, stuttering, confused
Helicopters line the sky
Marching men are rolling by
Babies in their baskets blankly stare through space, hey, hey

Ever since I first saw you
Standing in the black frozen night
I've been blind
But I'm driving in the dark towards you
Not stopping 'til I catch the sunlight
In my eyes

Sirens sing over the streets
Chimpanzees are on TV
Everybody's working, waiting for the week to end

Ever since I first saw you
Standing in the black frozen night
I've been blind
But I'm driving in the dark towards you
Not stopping 'til I catch the sunlight
In my eyes
And nothing's left to hide
Ever since I first saw you
Standing in the black frozen night
I've been blind
I'm running out of time
Ever since I first saw you
Standing in the black frozen night
I've been blind
But I'm driving in the dark towards you
Not stopping 'til I catch the sunlight
In my eyes
And nothing's left to hide"

Where we began

Smell of burning photographs slide slowly to my nostrils
I try remembering the soft silence of summer
Sweating in the evening

So once again, I swim in reverie

Wind blows through a hole in the roof
Brings your perfume like lilies to me
And all I can do is remember you

When was the last time I held you all through the night?
Feels like a zillion years and I don't wanna wait more
To find you is to lose you
What is that for?
Tell me


When was the last time I held you all through the night?
Never a worry would run through my heart like a knife
Feels like a zillion years and I don't wanna wait more
To find you is to lose you
What is that for?
One more night and I might never know who you are

When was the last time I held you all through the night?

No color you're all dressed in
And a stab in the back
Left you bleeding on the floor
And I'm mourning the death
The recent passing of your insides
I smile in regret
Every time I think of how I spoke to you
I put it all in back
Of my mind where I hold you
I'm just trying to keep track
How far back it really goes
And I'm living in lack
Of the blood sent from the heavens
I'm just trying to relax
As a killer's waiting right outside my door
What's black and white?
What's red all over?
This tired book
This organ donor
Sweet blasphemy, my giving tree
It hasn't rained in years
I bring to you this sacrificial offering
Of virgin ears
Leave it to me, I'll remain free
From all the comforts of home
And where that is, I'm pleased as piss to say
I'll never really know
I put 'em all in black
The four walls of my bedroom
And I trimmed them in red
Peeled your picture off the wall
And I'm living in lack
Of the blood sent from your heartbeat
That arrived in your neck
Every time I salivated over you
What's upside down?
What's coated in silver?
This crucifix is
My four leaf clover
Sweet blasphemy, my giving tree
It hasn't rained in years
I bring to you this sacrificial offering
Of virgin ears
Leave it to me, I'll remain free
From all the comforts of home
And where that is, I'm pleased as piss to say
I'll never really know

Throwing looks like those around
And one of these nights, I promise to you
I'll soon be sleeping sound, as soon as I leave town"

The Offspring,Spare Me the Details,Splinter,12/09/2003,"My girlfriend, my dumb donut
Went out to a party just the other night
But three hours later and seven shots of J'ger
She was in the bedroom with another guy

And I don't really wanna know
So don't tell me anymore
And I really don't wanna hear
About her feet all up in the air

And well, I'm not the one who acted like a hoe
Why must I be the one who has to know?
I'm not the one who messed up big time
So, spare me the details if you don't mind

Now I can understand friends who wanna tell me
Think they're gonna help me open up my eyes
But the play-by-play makes me wanna lose it
Every time you do it, man, it turns the knife

And I don't really wanna know
So don't tell me anymore
And I really don't wanna hear
About her feet all up in the air

And well, I'm not the one who acted like a hoe
Why must I be the one who has to know?
I'm not the one who messed up big time
So, spare me the details if you don't mind

Now I don't need to hear about the sounds they were making
And I don't need to hear about how long it was taking
Or how the walls, they were shaking

Now lying in bed, wallowing in sorrow
Missing the tomorrow that we could have had
Running through my head, over and over
Things I never told her now just make me sad
And it drives me insane, sitting with the vision
Stuck with that image burned into my brain
And I feel so dumb that I could ever trust her
While someone else fucked her, then walked away

And I don't really wanna to know
So don't tell me anymore
And I really don't wanna hear
About her feet all up in the air

And so, I'm not the one who acted like a hoe
Why must I be the one who has to know?
I'm not the one who messed up big time
So, spare me the details if you don't mind

And in the night we'll wish this never ends

The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

New Found Glory,Truth Of My Youth,Catalyst,05/18/2004,"There was a time and place
Where i never thought
I'd leave my own hometown
But those days finally
Are dead and gone
It was never my intention to stay there
Oh no
There was a conscious effort played by me
To disown anything I see
There was a girl I knew
Way back when
Who says she doesn't know me anymore
These are the lies the things you never mention
These are my past mistakes I'll stay away from

These are my thoughts written down on paper
It's my only savior
From not saying what I want to say
These are the thoughts that are on my mind
Moments that haven't yet been defined
And I don't know if you could ever understand
These are the things I can't say when we're alone

There were countless hours on the telephone
My ears were ringing from the dial tone
There were flashing lights
People staring
There was nothing i could ever do
These are the lies the things you never mention
These are my past mistakes I'll stay away from
This is the truth
The only time you'll hear it
I write it down because it seems so hard to say it"
Bad Religion,Let Them Eat War,The Empire Strikes First,06/08/2004,"There's a prophet on a mountain and he's making up dinner
With long division and a riding crop
Anybody can feel like a winner when it's served up piping hot
But the people aren't looking for a handout
They're America's working corps
Can this be what they voted for?

Let them eat war, let them eat war
That's how to ration the poor
Let them eat war, let them eat war
There's an urgent need to feed, declining pride

From the force to the union shops
The war economy is making new jobs
But the people who benefit most
Are breaking bread with their benevolent hosts
Who never stole from the rich to give to the poor
All they ever gave to them was a war
And a foreign enemy to deplore

Let them eat war, let them eat war
That's how to ration the poor
Let them eat war, let them eat war
There's an urgent need to feed, declining pride

We've got to kill 'em and eat 'em before they reach for their checks
Squeeze some blue collars, let them bleed from their necks
Seize a few dollars from the people who sweat
Cause it's freedom or debt and they won't question it
At a job site the boss is godlike
Conditioned workhorses park at a stoplight
Seasoned vets with their feet in nets
A stones throw away from a rock fight but not tonight
(Feed 'em death) Here comes another ration
(Feed 'em death) 'Cause they're the finest in the nation
(Feed 'em death) When there's nothing left to feed them with
When it's freedom or it's death

Let them eat war, let them eat war
That's how to ration the poor
Let them eat war, let them eat war
There's an urgent need to feed, declining pride"
Bad Religion,Los Angeles Is Burning,The Empire Strikes First,06/08/2004,"Somewhere high in the desert near a curtain of blue
Saint Ann's skirts are billowing
But down here in the city of limelights
The fans of Santa Ana are withering
And you can't deny that living is easy
If you never look behind the scenery
It's showtime for dry climes and
Bedlam is dreaming of rain

When the hills of Los Angeles are burning
Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
So many lives are on the breeze, even the stars are ill at ease
And Los Angeles is burning

This is not a test
Of the emergency broadcast system
When Malibu fires and radio towers
Conspire to dance again
And I cannot believe the media Mecca
They're only trying to peddle reality
Catch it on prime time, story at 9
The whole world is going insane

When the hills of Los Angeles are burning
Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
So many lives are on the breeze, even the stars are ill at ease
And Los Angeles is burning

A placard reads the end of days
Jacaranda boughs are bending in the haze
More a question than a curse, how could hell be any worse?
The flames are starting, the camera's running, so take warning

When the hills of Los Angeles are burning
Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
So many lives are on the breeze, even the stars are ill at ease
And Los Angeles is burning"

That tonight you should grant me this one wish
Like the one year of my life that I gave to you and
Now you put me through hell
You break me up, yeah
Whoa, I should hate you
But I can't replace you in my heart
Why am I so pathetic?
I don't get it
Why you won't return my calls
Can't you look at me once?
And please if you got a minute
Enjoy this lonely sky with me
It'll swallow us whole if we only let it
If I could only see you now for about an hour
Maybe just a minute

Is it his brown eyes?
Well, I'll give you a thousand reasons
That tonight you should grant me this one wish

Survey the scene
Finding two of the tallest trees
And I'll tie myself up
Above the cool earth
To dangle in the twilight
Oo-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I'm gonna get to the bottom of this
Gonna peel back my skin
And look at myself shaking and shivering
And as my skin collects in a pile on the ground
I'll radiate heat
And turn off my head
And just pretend that I don't exist
That I'll see clearly to the end
Of the ropes that i've been hanging from (woa-oh-oh)
As they loosen from the trees
I plummet to the ground to be impaled
And turned around (turn me right around)
Finally free from the ups and downs
And I'm gonna get to the bottom of this
Gonna peel back my skin
And look at myself shaking and shivering
And I'm gonna get to the bottom of this
Gonna peel back my skin
And look at myself shaking and shivering"

All! To! Blame!

How can we still succeed taking what we don't need?
Telling lies, alibis, selling all the hate that we breed
Super-size our tragedies (you can't define me, or justify greed)
Bought in the land of the free, (land, free)

And we're all to blame
We've gone too far, from pride to shame
We're trying so hard
We're dying in vain
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
To all we are
We want it all
With no sacrifice!

Stand to salute, say thanks to the man of the year
How did we all come to this? (you can't define me, or justify greed)
A greed that we just can't resist (resist)

Tell me now
What have we done

I can't allow
What has begun to tear me down, believe me now
We have no choice left with our backs against the wall!

And now
We're all to blame
We've gone too far
From pride to shame
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
When all we need
Is something true to believe
Don't we all

I am standing all alone
Please call me only
If you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live

In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope

There's a glow of light
The Saint Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust

What the hell's your name? (Ooh)
What's your pleasure and what is your pain? (Ooh)
Do you dream too much? (Ooh)
Do you think what you need is a crutch?

In the crowd of pain
Saint Jimmy comes without any shame
He says, 'We're fucked up, but we're not the same
And Mom and Dad are the ones you can blame.""

Jimmy died today (Ooh)
He blew his brains out into the bay (Ooh)
In the state of mind (Ooh)
It's my own private suicide

Well nobody cares, well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well nobody cares, well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?

Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on East 12th Street
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world and he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
His life's on the line with anxiety now
She had enough and he had plenty

Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here

So far away, I don't wanna stay (Ah-ha, la, la, la)

This life-like dream ain't for me!

After ten cups of coffee and you're still not here
Dreaming of a song, but something went wrong
And you can't tell anyone, 'cause no one's here
Left me here alone and I should have stayed home
After ten cups of coffee I'm thinking

Nobody likes you, everyone left you (Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you, havin' fun (Where'd you go?)
Everyone left you, nobody likes you (Where'd you go?)

I got a rock and roll band, I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend and another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house, I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums, and I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York, I got a kid in the Bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin' in over 22 days (Don't want to be an American idiot!)
So get off my case, off of my case
Off of my case!

Hey!

Here they come, marching down the street (Ooh-ooh)
Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat (Ooh-ooh)
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
The time has come and it's goin' nowhere (Ooh-ooh)
Nobody ever said that life was fair now (Ooh-ooh)
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bare
In the summer heat

The world is spinning 'round
And 'round, out of control again
The 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letterbomb
And visit me in Hell
We're the ones going

Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again

(Ooh) I started fuckin' running
As soon as my feet touched ground
(Ooh) We're back in the barrio
And to you and me, that's Jingle Town, that's

Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again

Wake me up when September ends

Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side

A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers

To alcohol and cigarettes
And Mary Jane to keep me insane
Doing someone else's cocaine

I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
That the center of the Earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less

City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care (Hey!)

I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care!
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care!
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care!
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care!
I don't care!

Everyone's so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia

Land of make believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make believe (Sons, it's another lie!)
And I don't believe
And I don't care
(Woo, woo, woo) I don't care
(Woo, woo, woo) I don't care
(Woo, woo, woo) I don't care
(Woo, woo, woo) I don't care

Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure

Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse

To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies

I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
The lights of masochists

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time

I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain when you've been victimized
Tales from another broken home
You're leaving
You're leaving
You're leaving
Ah, you're leaving home"
Green Day,Letterbomb,American Idiot [Japan Bonus Tracks],09/20/2004,"Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They're all out without you
Having fun

Where have all the bastards gone?
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collecting unemployment checks
Like a flunkie only along for the ride
Where have all the riots gone
As the city's motto gets pulverized?
What's in love is now in debt
On your birth certificate
So strike the fucking match to light this fuse!

The town bishop's an extortionist
And he don't even know that you exist
Standing still when it's do or die
You better run for your fucking life

It's not over 'till you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burnin'
It's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late
There is nothing left to analyze

Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself?
And where will we all go when it's too late?

And don't look back

You're not the Jesus of Suburbia
The St. Jimmy is a figment of
Your father's rage and your mother's love
Made me the idiot America

It's not over 'till you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burnin'
It's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late

I'm leaving it behind""
Well she said ""I can't take this town
I'm leaving you tonight"""
Green Day,She's a Rebel,American Idiot [Japan Bonus Tracks],09/20/2004,"She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction

From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they call ol' Whatsername
She's the symbol of resistance
And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade

Is she dreaming what I'm thinking?
Is she the mother of all bombs? Gonna detonate
Is she trouble like I'm trouble?
Make it a double twist of fate or a melody

She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Nothing comes to mind

She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous

Green Day,St. Jimmy,American Idiot [Japan Bonus Tracks],09/20/2004,"St. Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Light of a silhouette, he's insubordinate
Coming at you on the count of 1,2- 1,2,3,4!

My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out
Suicide commando that your momma talked about
King of the forty thieves, and I'm here to represent
The needle in the vein of the establishment

I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe
Raised in the city under a halo of lights
The product of war and fear that we've been victimized

I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

Are you talking to me?
I'll give you something to cry about
St. Jimmy!

My name is St. Jimmy, I'm a son of a gun
I'm the one that's from the way outside
I'm a teenage assassin executing some fun
In the cult of the life of crime
I'd really hate to say it but I told you so
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down, ol' boy
Welcome to the club and give me some blood
I'm the resident leader of the lost and found

It's comedy and tragedy
It's St. Jimmy
And that's my name
And don't wear it out!"
Green Day,Whatsername,American Idiot [Japan Bonus Tracks],09/20/2004,"Thought I ran into you down on the street
Then it turned out to only be a dream

I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been

Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry old Whatshisface?

I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been

Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
Remember, whatever

The regrets are useless in my mind
She's in my head, I must confess
The regrets are useless in my mind
She's in my head from so long ago

And in the darkest night
If my memory serves me right
I'll never turn back time
Forgetting you, but not the time"
Tsunami Bomb,4 Robots and an Evil Scientist,The Definitive Act,09/21/2004,"What you did to us was inexcusable
You disappointing, sallow scab
Took advantage of us got your way
Abused us, almost destroyed all we had

You took my passion

You begin to fantasize about how much money you'll be owed

Tsunami Bomb,A Lonely Chord,The Definitive Act,09/21/2004,"I never thought it mattered
Never thought it mattered so much
To me exactly where I put my feet
I was wrong
I drink a strong cup of coffee
A long time ago, I had a home
A corner where I could be alone
So goodbye my solid ground
I'm an engine, I won't break down
A lonely chord without a song
Searching for an orchestration where I belong
Where will I hang up my raincoat when this day is over?
Like a leaf without a tree
Nothing to cover over me
I'm like a character from a story
I don't exist
I owe a lot to these kids who are like family
They've helped me out with their endless generosity"

Nobody knows what's in your future
Though death and unhappiness are certain
But one thing I can say for sure;
Honesty's the perfect cure for any stress-induced disease you have
Believe what you do is right
Explain your reasonings
And everything will be alright

Tsunami Bomb,Dawn On A Funeral Day,The Definitive Act,09/21/2004,"Did you ever realize why there are no stars in the sky?
Because they're on the ground
The air is brown
We're trapped in this town
Let me go - I can't breathe
I drag myself through the debris
I never felt more alone than on this starry road
The air is warm but I feel grey
The chill of dawn on a funeral day
(I lie in unrest) While heavy dirt falls to my chest
(I fade away) And the hollow phantoms stay
Imagination in a chokehold, I've been steamrolled by gold records
Inspectors are watching over me, under lock and key
Chalk my outline; they'd talk of this if I'd died from a broken heart
They've taken art, turned it to something they think (We'll buy)
The air is warm but I feel grey
The chill of dawn on a funeral day
(I lie in unrest) While heavy dirt falls to my chest
(I fade away) And the hollow phantoms stay
My blood is their liquid vitamin
Their madness festers under their skin
The air is warm but I feel grey
The chill of dawn on a funeral day
(I lie in unrest) While heavy dirt falls to my chest
(I fade away) And the hollow phantoms stay
I have never felt so alone in my whole life"

What have you done?
Your life isn't for you anymore
Where have you gone?
Your old self is easy to ignore
You surrendered
Just follow the path they've laid out
You pretend to be happy
I want you back so I'll point out:
This is not about our future
It's about what we do now
Nothing is more real than life
And you have the right to be yourself in the crowd
I will miss you
I'm not good enough for you
No spring in your step
Your shining fire has been put out
Sealed yourself in
Nothing can affect your thick skin
I can't get through to you
And now you'll never learn anything new
You look around, creativity dead
You're missing out on the blues and reds
You're fucking blind!
Your brain has been immersed in whitewash"

No harm meant
Let's keep it that way
I'm quite content knowing that I don't know you -
I can pretend
Let's keep it that way

I don't want you going and screwing it up with your personality

I realized what I wanted to say:
Come what may

It's a marathon
I might be gone soon

I drop my machete to the floor
You look so happy-sad
I know I can't expect you'll wait for me
The soft taste of your lips
Conjures memories of a world
Where petals fall from above
It seems so far away
I am lost, to both of our dismay
Oh, I don't want to hurt you anymore
I drop my machete to the floor
You look so happy-sad
I know I can't expect you'll wait for me
Would someone please pass me the key
To this exam that I've written?

And why we should care
Songs stay with your your whole life
Remind you of time spent and time gone
Carry you through dismal days
And help you to carry on
I owe so many positive times to my favorite songs
It can be more than just sounds and words -
It can be something that saves you
From yourself
Your thoughts
Your life
Your world
It can be more than a favorite line -
It can be something that shapes you when you're young
But give you freedom at the same time"
Tsunami Bomb,Safety Song,The Definitive Act,09/21/2004,"We were in the graveyard
Shovel in hand and digging
Took one step in the hole
And realized it wasn't our time to go
We still had a lot of work, work to do
We took cement and filled up that grave again
Just like new
At the supermarket
Didn't know just what we needed
We searched high and low
Then found what it was on aisle 10
The perfect ingredient for our dead end
To no surprise, it was quite expensive
But worth the spend
Let's not try to foresee what happens now
All we know is that we're happy somehow
The timing was just right
Nowhere to go but forward now
We only have one rule
Freedom always allowed"

For some reason, no one has any advice to be told

No, I have to go, leave my old self behind
No, I have to know and solve what's on my mind
Promise that I will figure something out this time
No, I have to go

I suppose I wanted a change
So this is what I deserve
I know that I'm the one to blame
Whenever my stomach turns
In between each sad song
The happy ones are just as sour
They only remind me of
How all the days and nights were ours
 
So now I drive around alone, and I...
Don't get me wrong, I know it's all my fault

No, I have to go, leave my old self behind
No, I have to know and solve what's on my mind

Turned out were never even true

Some say we're better off without
Knowing what life is all about
I'm sure they'll never realize the way
It's too late
Somehow it's different everyday
In some ways it never fades away

I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please, I taste you all over my teeth
Never again. Just tonight? Okay

I can picture your face well from the bar in my hotel
I wish I'd go to you
I'll pick up, put down the phone

So go on, love
Leave while there's still hope for escape
You gotta take what you can these days

Do you feel bad, like I feel bad?
We'll pour us a road, we'll both drink and drive

Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
Leave you with the love we made

Come alive on the driver's side
So close I taste your breath
Your lips go dry, but they're sweet inside
Wine must go right to your head
It'd be easy if you get mad
But three fingers point back to you
We could stay here
Stay out all night
No one will know
Us and the moonlight

Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
Leave you with the love we made

I set my watch by a street-side clock
A needle in echo groove
You pierce my heart like a willing arm
Your ticking makes my blood move
There's no way out this fade out
Be happy to get what you do
Make him notice with both fists
'Cause quitting alone will never get you dry
Never get you dry

Give me everything you've got now
I don't feel a single thing
Drag me out into the cold rain
Let it hover over me
Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face

I feel that when I'm old
I'll look at you and know the world was beautiful

Then you tell me

You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go, I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me

I'm done, there's nothing left to show
I try but can't let it go
Are you happy where you're standing still?
Do you really want the sugar pill?
I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll start
Tonight it feels so hard
As the train approaches Gare Du Nord
As I'm sure your kiss remains employed
Am I only dreaming?

You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go, I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me

When you go, I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me"
Jimmy Eat World,The World You Love,Futures,10/19/2004,"I got a story, it's almost finished
Now all I need is someone to tell it to
Maybe that's you
Our time is borrowed and spent too freely
Every minute I have needs to be made up
But how?
I'm looking for a nice way to say, ""I'm out.""
I want out

I fall asleep with my friends around me
Only place I know, I feel safe
I'm going to call this home
The open road is still miles away
Hey, nothing serious
We still have our fun
Oh, we had it once

But windows open and close
That's just how it goes

Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love, forever gone
We're only just as happy as everyone else seems to think we are

I'm in love with the ordinary
I need a simple space
And rest my head
And everything gets clear
Well I'm a little ashamed for asking
But just a little helps
It gets me straight again
Helps me get over it, over it

It might seem like a dream
But it's real to me

Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we loved, forever gone
We're only just as happy as everyone else seems to think we are

You should see the canals are freezing
You should see me high
You should just be here
Be with me here
It doesn't seem there's hope for me
I let you down
But I won't give in now
Not for any amount

Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love, forever gone
We're only just as happy as everyone else thinks
Now, don't that feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love, forever gone
We're only just as happy as everyone else seems to think we are"

Green Day,Boulevard of Broken Dreams,American Idiot [Japan Bonus Tracks],11/29/2004,"I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me

When's it ever not?
The love we make is give and it's take
I'm game to play along

All I can say, I should've said

Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time

The best DJs are saving their slowest song for last
When the dance is through, it's me and you
Come on, would it really be so bad?
The things we think might be the same
But I won't fight for more
It's just not me to wear it on my sleeve
Count on that for sure

Get out of this place while we still have time
You want to take a ride?

To keep me safe for awhile
I think I'm gonna go hide myself
Behind hot water and tile
Every decade they say it's getting worse
I don't know if it's true or a cynical curse
But it's bearing down on me constantly
And pretty soon now, I think it's gonna burst
I'm not coming out of the shower
It's such a comfortable crutch
It's a warm loving womb, an intoxicating tomb
And I don't miss the outside world that much
Now all my harshest critics
Are screaming for murder
But I'm doing what we've done all along
I'm just taking it one step further
I've always been a good American
I drank a lot of soda and I didn't question
In whose deft hand the grenade was in
And now I feel someone is gonna pull the pin"

The dreams I've had
The open fields
The friendly kiss so natural

Those Latin globes behind soft hands
Like satin robes and Iberian sands
One more missed chance as I talk to her
It's lost, why bother!?!"

There's a pivot point in time now that a trail of yesterdays cannot erase
And it's never going to be the same again
And I'm not sure if that's a bad thing
No more innocence, a sense of fear has taken hold
Or maybe it's uncertainty of a brave new future untold
And it's never going to be the same again
And I'm not sure if that's a good thing
And if you pray to God
Ask her where she was

I'm just searching for a because"

And now I'm having my doubts
It seems that broken hearted love songs are what I'm all about
So while I'm sore from the smiles that you've given to me
I just can't wait for the day when inevitably
You say I'm not the guy you thought you knew when we have ""The Talk""
And you'll regrettably inform me that you're taking a walk
I'm so in love with you
But I just don't know what to do
It seems I lose my inspiration when my hearts not unglued
So now I welcome the pain
Oh yeah I'm praying for rain
To bring some dark black cloudy sadness to this warm sunny day
So while I'm sore from the smiles that you've given to me
I just can't wait for the day when inevitably
You say I'm not the guy you thought you knew when we have ""The Talk""
And you'll regrettably inform me that you're taking a walk
And I could write you the perfect song
And you could sing along
Yeah you could sing along
And I could write you the perfect song
About how everything's gone wrong
And you could sing along"

Running down the hallways of your dreams
Howling at the sickly silver moon

Gathers when the stars are out
Always in the audience
With their executions of the innocent
Can you see them?
You could be them
Oh there a jolly bunch
And they're coming after you
But if you give into them
You will become one of them
So much fun, can't we come to the vampire party with you
Always by the side of the road
Rushing passing lanes at night
Hidden in the corners of the room
High from the glare of your flood light
Listen to their voices in the gloom
Whispering their worlds devoid of truth
See them sitting on a fence
Croaking like crows in the wind
Can you see them
You could be them
Oh there a jolly bunch and there coming after you
But if you give into them
You will become one of them
So much fun, can't we come to the vampire party with you"
A Day to Remember,Heartless,And Their Name Was Treason,01/22/2005,"For once my eyes are open to you, and everything you've said
For once your web of lies is in the open
I gave you everything I had, until I had nothing left
Still you act as if I'm just a burden
I've finally let go. Let go, let go

Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on
Cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart
I've been around the world and back for you, and now it's time to choose

I've been swallowed by this wreck that you call your life
I'm damaged from the inside. I've been broken
Don't threaten me with what you think I feel
If you could read my mind you'd be in tears

I'm sick of your excuses you hold above me
I've finally come to terms with what I am
I'm nothing in your eyes, and this will not change
I'm living in a dream

Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on
Cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart
I've been around the world and back for you, and now it's time to choose

And I'll close my eyes, and dream of a better time
When I'll be finally past this and I'll be happy on my own
I've done all I can, and I've still been cast aside
All I ever wanted to be was be the one who would wipe tears from your eyes
But I guess I'll play second best, to a world that will never care about you
You'll never understand you're just another pretty face
You'll tell me that you care, and then run straight back to him
I can hear your voice of treason from a mile away

You never did know how to whisper

You're such a liar. Tell me the truth
You're such a liar. Tell me the truth
You're such a liar. Tell me the truth
Do the world a favor, stop cutting your arms, and slit your throat"

Step up, step up, step up

Nothing you say today
Is gonna bring me down
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say

Won't bring me down
Bring me down (Shut up, shut up, shut up)
Won't bring me

Simple Plan,Untitled (How Could This Happen to Me?),Still Not Getting Any...,04/01/2005,"I open my eyes
I try to see, but I'm blinded by the white light
I can't remember how, I can't remember why
I'm lying here tonight
And I can't stand the pain
And I can't make it go away
No, I can't stand the pain

How could this happen to me?
I've made my mistakes
Got nowhere to run
The night goes on as I'm fading away
I'm sick of this life
I just wanna scream
How could this happen to me?

Everybody's screaming
I try to make a sound, but no one hears me
I'm slipping off the edge, I'm hanging by a thread
I wanna start this over again
So I try to hold on to a time when nothing mattered
And I can't explain what happened
And I can't erase the things that I've done
No, I can't

How could this happen to me?
I've made my mistakes
Got nowhere to run
The night goes on as I'm fading away
I'm sick of this life
I just wanna scream
How could this happen to me?

I've made my mistakes
Got nowhere to run
The night goes on as I'm fading away
I'm sick of this life
I just wanna scream

Take my advice 'cause we are bad news

Into your notebook (Spit lines like these!)

A Day to Remember,1958,And Their Name Was Treason,05/10/2005,"And shepherds we shall be
For thee my lord for thee
Power hath descended forth from thy hand
That our feet may swiftly carry out thy command
So we shall flow river forth to thee
And teeming with souls shall it ever be
In nomine patris
Et filli
Et spiritus sancti

You've sunk lower than I've ever seen
And even though you deserved this
I tried to catch your fall
I've grown so tired of your childish threats
Know that I'll never run from anything

And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive

Here's where we prove all your fairytales wrong
This all stops tonight
Swim in your sea of smoke
Until your lungs lose the fight
It's over
This all stops tonight
Or prove me wrong

What have you become through your jealousy?
You've threatened my life, my friends and family
This is your last wrong turn in your life
And this dead end leads to a blood bath
Your blood bath

And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive

Here's where we prove all your fairytales wrong
This all stops tonight
Swim in your sea of smoke
Until your lungs lose the fight
It's over
This all stops tonight
Or prove me wrong

You'll never stop us with your one-man army
We would burn him alive
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
If you're such a man then bring the fight
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
We would burn him alive
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
If you're such a man then bring the fight

This is me calling you out
You want to talk like a man, then be a man
Stop talking like you're something (We're paging 1958)
You always have so much to say but it's never to our faces
I'm right here (We're paging 1958)
We're all one and the same
We're moving on, and living our dreams (We're paging 1958)

A Day to Remember,You Had Me At Hello,And Their Name Was Treason,05/10/2005,"I'm missing you so much, I'll say you died tonight
Just so I can get to you before the sun will rise
I know these times are hard and I feel this too
None of that ever seems to matter when I'm holding you

And I'm wasting away, away from you
And I'm wasting away, away from you

What have I gotten into this time around
I know that I had sworn I'd never trust
Anyone again but I didn't have to
You had me at hello

I've never seen a smile that can light the room like yours
It's simply radiant, I see it more with every day that goes by
I watch the clock to make my timing just right
Would it be okay?
Would it be okay if I took your breath away?

And I'm wasting away, away from you
And I'm wasting away, away from you

What have I gotten into this time around
I know that I had sworn I'd never trust
Anyone again but I didn't have to
You had me at hello

A Day to Remember,You Should've Killed Me When You Had The Chance,And Their Name Was Treason,05/10/2005,"So I say goodbye to a town that has ears and eyes
I can hear you whispering as I walk by
Familiar faces smiling back at me and I knew
This would make them change

The only thing that's going to bother me
Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends
Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?

The writings on the wall, you've read that I'll be gone, but if you call my name
Just know that I'll come running, for one more night to spare with you
This is where I'm meant to be, please don't leave me

I've read these stories a thousand times, and now I'll rewrite them all
You're meddling in an anger you can't control
She means the world to me, so hold your serpent tongue
Is a whores lies worth dying for? Trust me, I'm done

The only thing that's going to bother me
Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends
Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?

The writings on the wall, you've read that I'll be gone, but if you call my name
Just know that I'll come running, for one more night to spare with you
This is where I'm meant to be, please don't leave me

I walked into your house this morning
I brought the gun from our end table
Your blood was strewn across the walls
They'll find you on your bathroom floor
I walked into your house this morning
I brought the gun from our end table
Your blood was strewn across the walls
They'll find you on your bathroom floor when I'm done
But should I write it all off?

But should I write it all off?
But should I write it all off?
But should I write it all off?

Alkaline Trio,Fall Victim,Crimson,05/24/2005,"Not sure how this is supposed to feel
Cutting like a red hot knife of surgical steel
Brought fresh from the autoclave
She came, she came with sterile warnings
Screaming from her blade
Singing, I wanna make you bleed
I watched them fall in line, as I fell victim
To double suicide on your television
We heard our records backwards too many times
I'm wasting my breath, we're wasting our time
Down on my knees, but not to pray
Hit so hard across the skull it buckled my legs
They told me I had hell to pay
I came, I came too close to heaven
Had nothing to say for myself
I had to walk away
I watched them fall in line, as I fell victim
To double suicide on your television
We heard our records backwards too many times
I'm wasting my breath, we're wasting our time
Wasting our time, wasting our time
I watched them fall in line, as I fell victim
To double suicide on your television
We heard our records backwards too many times
I'm wasting my breath, we're wasting ours"
MxPx,Heard That Sound,Panic,06/06/2005,"Without a window to see through
I did my time, in here without you
Slept on the floor down in the LEC
Meet me back home under the marque
It seems like misery loves misery
My favourite songs they keep me company
So many memories come down to this
I maybe be lost but i'm not hopeless
I heard that sound a mile away
I heard that sound a mile away
All those things i wish that i could say
I heard that sound a mile away
A mile away
Came in like static off the tv
This kinda thing never goes easy
I meant to tell you but you were gone
I tried to get it right, I got it all wrong
I heard that sound a mile away
I heard that sound a mile away
All those things i wish that i could say
I heard that sound a mile away
A mile away
Sat outside the show
With nowhere else, nowhere else to go
Don't say ""can't see""
It sure does sound, good to me
(Whoa oaaa) Na Na Na Na Na (Whoa oaaa)
Don't save yourself....good to me
(Whoa oa) Na Na Na Na Na
Good to you....good to me

MxPx,Wrecking Hotel Rooms,Panic,06/06/2005,"I wrecked your hotel room
I crashed up the car
Slept in the gutter
I'm outside your door

Saw you through the key hole
Down on your knees
There's really no reason to call the police

Do you hold the phone when you're alone
Imagine that it rings then hold it to your ear
And wish that I was there to sing you off to sleep
Be with you in your dreams for the days I will be gone
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song

I know you don't know me
Cause we've never met
I'm not really crazy
So don't get upset

I've got all these problems
None with solutions
Been in and out of some nice institutions

Do you hold the phone when you're alone
Imagine that it rings then hold it to your ear
And wish that I was there to sing you off to sleep
Be with you in your dreams for the days I will be gone
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song

Do you hold the phone when you're alone
Imagine that it rings then hold it to your ear
And wish that I was there to sing you off to sleep
Be with you in your dreams for the days I will be gone
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song

The Offspring,Can't Repeat,Greatest Hits,06/20/2005,"I woke the other day
And saw my world has changed
The past is over, but tomorrow's wishful thinking
I can't hold onto what's been done
I can't grab onto what's to come
And I'm just wishing I could stop, but

Life goes on, come of age
Can't hold on, turn the page
Time rolls on, wipe these eyes
Yesterday laughs, tomorrow cries

Memories are bittersweet
The good times we can't repeat
Those days are gone and we can never get them back
Now we must move ahead
Despite our fear and dread
We're all just wishing we could stop, but


With all our joys and fears
Wrapped in forgotten years
The past is laughing as today just slips away
Time tears down what we've made
And sets another stage
And I'm just wishing we could stop


Time rolls on"
Alkaline Trio,Time to Waste,Crimson,06/27/2005,"There's someone down below blowing you a kiss
They watch from their windows
As all arms fall to their sides, and all eyes fix
On the death of tomorrow
And you found everything you need
To make a life complete
Completely revolting, and they have safety and relief
For sale up the street
I see you in line everyday
You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill, it's dead and buried
You've got guts to spill, but no one trustworthy
These creatures are waking up in these dark trees
Waiting like vultures
Eyes roll back, turn white in time to feed
They salivate in hunger
For you and everything they need
To make a death complete
Completely unnatural and salvation lies
Behind those dead eyes
That watch you while you sleep every night
And you had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill its dead and buried
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy
You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill its dead and buried

Your teeth are sharpened you have hungry eyes, where did you take us
Your family honor is weak, balloon of loyalty has got a leak, how can I trust you when
I know you'll sell me
You're not more than a monster made of glass please see the truth
And since you're not more than a, a monster made of glass we'll shatter you
We'll shatter you
I have no many friends who deserve so much more
By helping each other we get the force of a wrecking ball smashing up all your teeth
Soon you'll be helpless and we'll be free

That word is avenge from your library of quarterly proceeds"

Ain't nobody around
I've been to your city
Ain't no city like Cincinnati
The first time I've been there
In the rollin heat
I saw black love spent
And angel wings
I saw white dust choke
And kill and end the violence
And I know I'm running the American Dream
Red, White, and Blue blood
Run at the seams
Bitter sweet liberty
Don't mean shit to me
Hey I've been to your town
Ain't nobody around
Hey baby I've been to your city
Ain't no city like Cincinnati
Hey I run along to Mexico
Some water is cold up the coast
You know I bleed the sun
The ressurection
I run along to Ohio
Drive past the grave of an old romance
Never felt more alive than Suicide Cincinnati
Cincinnati
And I've been to your town
Ain't nobody around
Hey baby I've been
To your city
Ain't no city like Cincinnati
Here we are...
In utopia"

Simple Plan,Crazy,Still Not Getting Any...,10/18/2005,"Tell me what's wrong with society
When everywhere I look, I see
Young girls dying to be on TV
They won't stop till they've reached their dreams
Diet pills, surgery
Photoshopped pictures in magazines
Telling them how they should be
It doesn't make sense to me

Is everybody going crazy?
Is anybody gonna save me?
Can anybody tell me what's going on?
Tell me what's going on?
If you open your eyes
You'll see that something is wrong

I guess things are not how they used to be
There's no more normal families
Parents act like enemies
Making kids feel like it's World War III
No one cares, no one's there
I guess we're all just too damn busy
And money's our first priority
It doesn't make sense to me

Is everybody going crazy?
Is anybody gonna save me?
Can anybody tell me what's going on?
Tell me what's going on?

You'll see that something is wrong

Tell me what's wrong with society
When everywhere I look I see
Rich guys driving big SUVs
While kids are starving in the streets
No one cares
No one likes to share
I guess life's unfair

Is anybody gonna save me?
Can anybody tell me what's going on?

How much honesty's healthy
Say what's on your mind
The only way to be
The drugs are only for dessert
Do your homework first
We don't administer the cure for that thirst
'Cause it's always been heartbreaking music
So close to death we use it
Killing
Writing this over and over
It will never mend
I am the jest malignant cell
Playwright to your hell

I could I have changed your mind
Would of, should of, the question 'til I die

Stop, turn, take a look around
At all the lights and sounds
Let them bring you in
Slow burn, let it all fade out
Pull the curtain down
And wonder where you've been
Make it new but stay in the lines
Just let go but keep it inside
Smile big for everyone
Even when you know what they've done
They gave you the end but not where to start
Not how to build, how to tear it apart
So tell it all and fill up the air
But make it loud cause nobody's there

And I can feel the fire of the city lights burn
And it's hard to find angels in hell

Flying along, and I
Feel like I don't belong, and I
Can't tell right from the wrong, and why
Have I been here so long
In a city of devils we live
A city of devils we live
Questions I can't seem to find
To the answers I already have
And you can't see the sky here at night
So I guess I can't make my way back

What if I wanted you here right now?
Would you fall in the fire burn me down?

They tell us about when we're young
Rescuers working to clean up the crashes
Before she can see what they've done
Nobody told her she'd lose in the first round
The last fight was fixed from the start
Names on her sidewalks, they move through her body
Like razors they cut through her heart
Like razors they cut through her heart

Hey, let go of all you know
And you're flying away now
What have you got to lose?
And say out loud these words I've found
I'll be there when you come down
I'll be waiting for you

So someone remembers her, too
But somewhere she heard there was some place to go
When you die, when you live like we do
Die when you live like we do

My friend the giant and traveling sails
Tell you all the times that I failed
The years all behind me, the stories exhaled

And I'm drying out, crying out
This isn't how I go

I could tell you of a man not so tall
Who said life's a circus, and so we are small
Tell you of a girl that I saw
I froze in the moment and she changed it all

And I'm drying out, crying out
This isn't how I go
Hurry now, lay me down
And let these waters flow, flow

Son, I am not everything you thought that I would be
But every story I have told is part of me
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

And you keep the air in my lungs
Floating along as a melody comes
And my heart beats like timpani drums
Keeping the time while a symphony strums

And I'm drying out, crying out
This isn't how I go
Hurry now, lay me down
And let these waters flow
Flow, flow
Let it flow (Let it flow)

Yellowcard,Two Weeks from Twenty,Lights and Sounds,01/24/2006,"Jimmy wasn't really popular, he had a couple of friends back home
And sooner or later they're all getting out so he had to join up alone
He was dreaming of the Ivy league since he was only three feet tall
And get the hell out of Jersey and then he would never look back at all
And then your hear 'em say
That miles away
We lost another one that we sent with a gun
They're gonna miss him, he was two weeks from twenty
And there's still no shame
From the man to blame
Jimmy never had a reason to stay 'cause all the factories shut down
All he had was a line for his name so he could sign away his right to be proud
He tried to kiss her on the way out the door, but she just put her little hand on his face
'I don't understand why you're leaving', she said, 'but I hope you're gonna ask me to wait'
And then your hear 'em say
That miles away
We lost another one that we sent with a gun
His lady missed him, he was two weeks from twenty
And there's still no shame
From the man to blame
Jimmy's mother went to Capitol Hill so she could fill her heart up with joy
Maybe shake a few hands while she's there, and tell him 'thank you, sir, for taking my boy'

His mama missed him, he was two weeks from twenty

Why did I say all those things before I was sure?

(She is the one)
And I have to fight this
(She is the one)
The villain I can't knock down

I see your face with every punch I take
And every bone I break, it's all for you
And my worst pains are words I cannot say
Still I will always fight on for you
Mary's alive in the bright New York sky
The city lights shine for her, above them I cry for her
Everything's small on the ground below, down below
What if I fall, then where would I go, would she know?

Crashing inside you like motorbikes
We toss and turn, sleep so loud
Grind the teeth in our empty mouths
Our empty...
There's a forest fire burning bright
Spreading quickly towards our last rites
Nowhere to run, pointless to hide
Just lay there and scream, pretending to try
Pretending...
Intending to burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and you burn
This impending doom is left deep inside
And it's haunting you each and every night
Like starving wolves counting sheep
We close our eyes, pretending to sleep
Descending...
Intending to burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn, you live and
Like hell, we are anxiously waiting
Like hell, burning silently strong
Somehow we fell down by the wayside
And somehow this hell is home
As we burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and...
Like hell, we are anxiously waiting
Like hell, burning silently strong
Somehow we fell down by the wayside
And somehow this hell is home
Right now, this hell is my home"

You're wrong about drug use, when its not abuse

A victim of Cointelpro

Are already pushing prams
I loved you then as I love you still
Tho I put you on a pedestal
They put you on the pill
I dont feel bad about letting you go
I just feel sad about
Letting you know
I dont want to change the world
Im not looking for a new england
Im just looking for another girl
I dont want to change the world
Im not looking for a new england
Im just looking for another girl
I loved the words you wrote to me
But that was fucking yesterday
I can't survive on what you send
Every time you needing a friend
I saw two shooting stars last night
I wished on them but they were only satellites
Is it wrong to wish on space hardware
I wish, I wish, I wish youd care

The stars that pierce the sky

Oh, how they all adored him
Beauty will last when spiraled down
The stars that mystify
He left them all behind
And how his children cried
He left us all behind

Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?

What's the hook, the twist
Within this verbose mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light
Will fizzle out without hope
We're the empty set just floating through, wrapped in skin
Ever searching for what we were promised
Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

Cut off my legs when you tell me to walk
Slit my own throat when you say to talk

See myself in shredded skin
Sew my lips together
So I won't have to say a word
What I never meant to say
I wish I could erase it
Make it right again some day

And drown in the blood as it fills my lungs

Just a few moments to live, no remorse for what I did
It was for the betterment of man, I made the utmost sacrifice
Before more damage could be done I took his life
There was a split second of silence when the dart punctured the skin
Beady eyes rolled back in head, the body dropped from the poison
They could incapacitate me but could not erase my sneer
I heard a thousand people screaming while three billion others cheered
He was gone and I would soon be...
Executed by the state, all appeals would be in vain
I was not criminally insane, in fact I was found to be
An otherwise caring and respectable member of society
A minor threat except for that one man I killed
As the sedatives take effect, I just smile and close my eyes
There's a priest kneeling next to me, he asks me if I realize
I was going straight to hell and he thought that I should know
That the man I killed's replacement planned this whole scenario

I left the hybrid at home
I scored an extremely rare
Signed copy of The Communist Manifesto
We protested the G8
Got maced by female police

You're better, you're better
Your designer drug
Won't work, won't work for me
Connect to a three volt
I hope your battery dies
How could you run
On such, on such voltage?

All the same, I remain
The one to blame
And I'm demonized, purified
Justified, as you let yourself show

So now, you'll love these screams, what's left of me
(Don't speak)
Love these screams, like I do
(My name)

As the infinite stops cold
Just nine and the six are gone
Guess I was the one to
Ride that, ride that dirty ride
That is turning too fast now
I c-c-cannot, cannot hold on
But at this pace
Who would, who would want to?

All the same, I remain
The one to blame
And I'm demonized, purified
Justified, as you let yourself show

Press your lips to the sculptures
And surely, you'll stay (love like winter)
For of sugar and ice
I am made, I am made

It's in the blood)
I met my love before I was born
(He wanted love
I taste of blood)
He bit my lip, and drank my war
From years before, from years before

She exhales vanilla lace
I barely dreamt her, yesterday (yesterday)
Read the lines in the mirror through the lipstick trace
(Por siempre)
She said, ""It seems you're somewhere far away,"" to his face

Am I beautiful?
Am I usable?

Put on your face and let's pretend
These killing lights won't kill us all again

Three A.M. on the city street
When the air is sweet, I've had my mouth full
But it seems that outside the screen
Such a pretty face often will look dreadful

Am I beautiful?
Am I usable?

They never forget a face

The Bouncing Souls,For All The Unheard,The Gold Record,06/06/2006,"A guitar collects dust like his heart, soundless and still
A girl collapses on her bed, writing words never read
Troubled youth spills over into troubled life and times
We walk along with our troubled minds
A guitar strikes a chord, hits a misery so hard, so bold
Sounding through this world where it's so hard to feel that gold
It's running through a song of beauty buried deep under a river of greed
Where the muddy waters flow and the stones don't roll
This is for all the unheard, all the music left behind
All the songs left on the floor in the closets of our minds
Where's the passion gone in our hearts, lost somewhere in the grind?
It's time to bring it back, it's time to unwind, find what we lost, it's time
It's time to bring it back
A lost song lingers on
Bouncing off stars on and on
A moment gone, or is it looking for you
To sing its tune?
Troubled youth spills over into troubled life and times
We walk alone with our troubled minds
This is for all the unheard, all the music left behind
All the songs left on the floor in the closets of our minds

The Bouncing Souls,Letter From Iraq,The Gold Record,06/06/2006,"Hot Sunni sun passes moaning mosque spire
B-company's pinned down under heavy fire
Underneath the palms there's improvised bombs
Because Jihad Johnny knows Yankee is a liar
An eye for an eye and blood for Texas tea
At the call to prayer al-Qaeda's on its knees
Isaac versus Ishmael, Allah versus Christ
Zarqawi's on the offense picking up the beat
There's celebratory fire and a purple thumb vote
Tom Cruise is on the saudi from the Gulf love boat
Smart bombs are coming, see the children running
The dead, they are all laughing, but we don't get the joke
An eye for an eye and blood for Texas tea
At the call to prayer al-Qaeda's on its knees
Isaac versus Ishmael, Allah versus Christ
Zarqawi's on the offense picking up the beat
They lost another friend today
It's getting rough over there, they say the whole thing's fucked
I wish the boys were back, at least I know they're still alive
Another letter from Iraq
Presents full of Christmas loot
All that's left of Bullet Billy is a pair of bloody boots
His mom is on the phone, his girl is all alone
We all stand in the rain for a twenty-one gun salute"

Those ties that were so sweet also burned under his feet

And he can't turn back
He can't turn back
He can't turn back
Running through the crowds
He made it out alive
Betting everything on himself tonight
She's driving down the shore on a Jersey afternoon
She's driving down the same old road her parents took her through
Hypnotized by those broken lines, broken records lost in time
She's turning down a road that is new
And she can't turn back
No, she can't turn back
She can't turn back
Stepping through the darkness
Into the light
Betting everything on herself tonight
Stepping out of the Asbury Lanes in the midnight snow
The skeleton of this old town feels like it's coming alive
Riots and corruption, beaches and Bruce
These songs were the keys to the engines of our growing up
And we wanna say thanks to the music in our lives
Forgive ourselves for all the lies
Send some love to all the lonely
Don't forget we're all one family
Thanks to the music in our lives
For helping us to survive
Lost in one lonely dream
Born to run and live free
The sun shines brightly on us this afternoon
Walking in our own footsteps, a search for something new
And we can't turn back
No, we can't turn back
We can't turn back
Stepping through the darkness
Into the light
We're betting everything, we're betting everything
We're betting everything on ourselves tonight"

On lonely mornings like this
This emptiness inside, loneliness I feel
In this pain I'm not alone, in this city that is my home
One lonely heart reaching out to you
One strength to see us through
Alone together, this one goes out to you
We are not alone in this city that is our home"

Pizza's cooking in a storefront oven
On the corner a boy is waiting
The moonlight feels cold and desperate
Some hidden sadness is bound down
Attention lives all over town
Ready to burst open into driving
Burning, exploding sound
If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming all along
Tony's making slice pies for the lunch rush
Stirring the sauce, pounding out the dough
His brother left town with his girl
She ain't his girl no more
And some days, they seem to never end
So mundane in this old town
Ready to burst open into driving
Burning, exploding sound
If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming all along
May all these walls we've made
In our wasted years and days
Not stand in our way
That we may feel the winds of change
If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming all along
If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming, coming, coming, coming, coming all along"

My heart skipped a beat today
Reminding me of those lost days and glory never fades
Never fades, fades away
After years and miles, my broken feet
Walk back to you up this broken street
I guess the years went by, but the years just made you shine
And never fade, fade away
I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold
I saw you from across the street today
My heart skipped a beat today
Reminding me of those lost days
And glory never fades
Years passed by and you remind me
Those things will always find me
Young hearts are made of gold that never fades away
Never fades, fades away
I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold
As the years pass by
A young heart beats inside
These dreams of yours and mine that time can't take away
Take away, take away

That nothing gold can stay

And mark a place in time for every chance you took?

I've yet to take the hint, someday
I'm sure I'll get the picture
And stop waiting up

When it all comes down
To a sunrise on the East Side
Will you be there to carry home
The remains of my wasted youth?
This wasted time on you
Has left me shaking in waiting
Shaking in waiting for something more

Tonight is alive with the promise of a street-fight
And there's money on the table
That says your cheap shots won't be able to break bones
I've yet to break a sweat
I'll make your past regret its future
Here's to you

To a sunrise on the East Side

We'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like
Make all of my decisions for me
I've never taken the fall for deceit
We'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like this

I can keep a secret if you can keep me guessing
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me pressing
For more than just a moment of truth between the lies told
To pull ourselves away from the lives we leave back
(I can keep a secret if you can keep me guessing)
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me here, keep me here

Jasey (Say you'll mean it)
You're dressed to kill, I'm calling you out

A stabbing pain that says I lack
The common sense and confidence
To bring an end to promises
That I make in times of desperate conversation
Hoping my night could be better than theirs in the end
Just say when

Don't make this easy
I want you to mean it
Jasey (Say you'll mean it)
You're dressed to kill, I'm calling you out
(Don't waste your time on me)

I've never told a lie and that makes me a liar
I've never made a bet but we gamble with desire
I've never lit a match with intent to start a fire
But recently the flames are getting out of control
Call me a name, kill me with words
Forget about me, it's what I deserve
I was your chance to get out of this town
But I ditched the car and left you to-
Wait outside, I hope the air will serve to remind you
That my heart is as cold as the clouds of your breath
And my words are as timed as the beating in my chest"

Scream to be heard, like you needed any more attention;
Throw the bottle, break the door and disappear

Sing me to sleep, I'll see you in my dreams
Waiting to say, ""I miss you. I'm so sorry.""

Forever's never seemed so long as when you're not around
It's like a piece of me is missing
I could have learned so much from you, but what's left now?
Don't you realize you showed this family a world of pain?
Can't you see this should have been a happy ending we let go?

Sing me to sleep, I'll see you in my dreams
Waiting to say, ""I miss you. I'm so sorry.""

Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep

Even in the summer
She was wrapped in a blanket by the pool

I couldn't bare to touch
I couldn't bare it

It's not your fault so please stop your crying now
Please stop your crying now

There was staring and seclusion
A fine tuned way of motion
A face wrapped for a suitor
The sound of hearts pumping at the same beat
Coming 'round the corner
In almost all directions
A sense of heat that
I couldn't bare to touch
No, I couldn't bare it

Just because I could
You're so close but you're so very, very, very far away
Tonight we dance, tomorrow we'll talk
Maybe on Thursday we'll fall in love

Where there once was a connection
There is an absence of any feeling
The words to me mean nothing now
Nor will they ever again
They speak of losing someone as if it's final
As I drift closer to the end
There are no songs
For the man of infirmity
Well the arrow through the heart
And the needle through the vein
Can't be bothered with any heartache
It's got nothing on this pain
Now I don't want some extravagant production
No nostalgia at my age
All I want is someone who knows my shame
Who can play me off the stage
There are no songs
For the man of infirmity"
The Ergs,Radio K,Jersey's Best Prancers,01/01/2007,"Well it's getting kind of cold
So I'll take the skyway home
I don't want to be alone
But you've given me no choice
I bet they had a great big laugh back home
When you told them what I've done
Oh I thought you were the one
Talk about the biggest lie
St. Paul is cynical
As I rattle off my problems
To no one listening
And I'm listening to Radio K
Drown my sorrows in the frequency
And I'm listening to Radio K
As she drives away"
The Ergs,Short Stories,Jersey's Best Prancers,01/01/2007,"Oh Eveline
I'm so tired of saying the wrong thing
While amped up on caffeine
Sweaty hand-soaked paper notes
Freeform acts and deleted scenes
""I think you're beautiful,"" I said
Then the next week you were gone
You moved out to another town
You're the main character
In my short stories
There are no happy ends
Oh Eveline
I'm so tired of saying the wrong thing
While amped up on caffeine
A furiously scribbled out manuscript
New revisions of fucked up dreams
""You said, 'You think I'm cool',"" she said
How do I interpret that?
What the hell does that mean?
Oh Eveline
I'm so tired of saying the wrong thing
While amped up on caffeine
Oh Eveline"
The Ergs,Bike Shoppe,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Went to the city, we played stickball
One hundred degrees and a fog of mosquitoes
And to think that I feel old here
Don't call me sir, I'm just a boy
The sounds of a skateboard on a sidewalk
Ice cream and candy and a soda
I'm just glad there are no cops here
Just you, me and the world
The earth won't stop for me
How long is the summer and how many are there?
If there's another, let's do something impulsive
Six weeks on a roadtrip
Or a lifetime of regret
The earth won't stop for me"
The Ergs,Books About Miles Davis,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"I'm thinking of a girl
She came around here a couple years before
I'm much older now
And it would be wonderful
If I could re-write history
All of these could've beens
I guess they're left to mystery
And you could say I'm falling in love
And you probably will
I'm thinking a lot more
I'm freaking out and you've heard it all before
I apologize
And I'm having these restless nights
And I swear it's growing tired
You say ""it's all good"" and ""I'm preaching to the choir""
And you could say I'm ""a little insane""
And you probably will
This is all I've got
I'll quit my job and I'll sell this vacant lot that is my life
And I'll settle down in a place I've only read about in books about Miles Davis
I'll bust right through that door and say
I'm here to save us and then
You could say I should probably go
And you probably will"
The Ergs,"Boston, Massachusetts",Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Heard a song
From the album ""Boston, Mass.""
By the Del Fuegos the other day
It sounded good
I remembered how you used to like them
So I wrote this letter but I didn't send it out
Did you ever get married?
I don't think I wanna know
'Cause this torch that I carry
Is burnin' up my soul
When I heard them sing the verses
Of ""Hand In Hand"" and ""I Still Want You""
In that record store in Brooklyn
It made me think about that summer and you
And you and the album ""Boston, Mass.""
By the Del Fuegos the other day"
The Ergs,Girls of the Market Square,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Steel pyramids bear the load
Of a secret girl that I just saw
Her naive eyes dart forward
The red lights read segmented black
She's always changing her mind
She's giving advice or giving out signs
The cigarette smoke is rising and
The coffee rolls off her lips
Oh, girls of market square
Can't help but hide my eyes
Apathetic look in her eyes
I'd like to see what she has seen
A stick figure in a painting of
Fat ladies barking this and that
She's reading my favorite book
And funny, last night I dreamt of her
We were at some religious function
Who knew her and I shared a god?"
The Ergs,Hysterical Fiction,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Guess I should change the sheets
Now that the word is you're never coming back
I've heard there's a chemical
In the skin that keeps one attached
Howling wolves turn into losers
Battered wives return to abusers
Lying in the corner, broken intravenous users
I'm gonna take your pillowcase down to the lab
I'm gonna precipitate what's left of what we had
And you can smoke it
You can smoke it
Now I got a business model
To make all this bullshit obsolete
Co-dependence powder for sale
Down at your pharmacy
They say the best revenge is to live well
If I can be a millionaire, then hell
I won't have to break the rule
On taking what you're selling
Don't wait for the nice Serling twist
Put everything back like it is
Not gonna burn it all down to the ground"
The Ergs,It'll Be O.K.,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"I've got a loveseat with a front beam cracked and broken
I've got some things to say to you that are better left unspoken
Maybe we could lean together, try to share some warmth
Can't go back to what it was or say that we weren't warned
I've got a handful of the
Day's hours left to go before
I fall dead asleep and
Then head off to work once more
Maybe we could lie together staring straight ahead
Lines of vision parallel, they'll never intersect
At the end of the night and the inevitable flight
Where we both finally realize we can't get this right
Even if it crumbles by the breaking light of day
It'll be ok
I've got a little bit of time to try to sort it out
When it's stolen by a random nothing it only fuels the doubt
That we're holding things together
By the trite-est of cliches"
The Ergs,See Him Again,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"You and I
Could never see eye to eye
Cause you were always making his day
And you're always making me wait
I can see
The smiles that you gave to me
And taken back and meant for someone else
I don't know
But I guess it's slightly better than being alone
Getting half your saccharine kisses to call my own
When you say, ""I'll never leave, rest assured""
It's the greatest lie I've ever heard
And I believe every word
I can see
The smiles that you gave me
Are faded and non-existent now
And so am I
And anyway it's gonna work out right for you
If you leave cause he's a better man for you
But if you stay there's something I must ask of you
If you see him again
Tell him you never wanna see him again
I know I'm being selfish
But I can't deal with this"
The Ergs,Stinking of Whiskey Blues,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"I've heard it said it takes twice the length
Of an affair for the heart to heal
And if that's the case then I guess in 20 years
I'll be sitting on this barstool still
Cause you were the one
I felt that I was lucky just to have you by my side
Now it's 10 years gone and I'm sitting all alone
Drinking and stuff
Bar time is 6:30
And you're still on my mind
By 8:15 I already have a couple in me
And I've already forgotten you were even mine
By 9:43 I'll be regretting my decisions
And cursing this city of sin
By 10:15 I'll be stinking of whiskey
And thinking of you again
I've heard it said by many of my friends
You were a girl I should leave alone
They said all you're gonna do is check
Into your room only to find a Gideon's Bible
Now all I got are those and 15 ""I told you so's""
So I guess I'm the one to blame
Sitting on a stool feeling like a broken fool
A tarnished drunkard with a tarnished name"
The Ergs,"The Clocks, The Clocks",Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Hello Katelyn, let's start another
Bullshit day among the rest
Grab your coffee and a smile
And we'll blow through this f*cking mess
Maybe I could make a stupid joke
Maybe you could have another smoke
And we plot our f*cking way out of this town
I wake up early too
And I punch this clock the same as you
And I don't like it anymore than you do
Take comfort in the fact you're not alone"
The Ergs,Things I Could Never Find a Way to Say,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Ummm, so...
I was wondering if maybe
You could do something next Friday
Cause I think your band is pretty great
And your hair looks really cute that way
And I know this might seem sudden and crazy
But these are the things I could never find a way to say
And if you'd be my girl
It would be so cool
If you'd if my girl
It'd be so indie rock
It's a shame"
The Ergs,Trouble in River City,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"I guess you didn't notice but I get this all the time
I know what you're doing here
You've come here fighting loneliness
And you wish you were mine
Well save your Harvey Danger references, I'm spoken for
I don't mean to bring you down
But there'll be trouble in River City if you're around
You need to make a getaway
And I'm parked right outside
I need you to get out of here
You look less than sober but I'm ok to drive
I need to get you out of here"

I know I'm stupid
I know you're ok
I know I blew it
I know you don't think much of me
I couldn't blame you cause I'm the one who broke your heart
I know that its pretty fucking pointless
Trying to make some peace cause you're happy leaving me behind
I know that if you saw me on the street
You would walk right past
You wouldn't even see that we used to be this close
We used to be like best friends
Now you don't care anymore
Now you can't believe what I did
To you

The Ergs,Your Cheated Heart,Upstairs/Downstairs,01/01/2007,"Your cheated heart is getting rusty
Your cheated heart has never been so broken
Your cheated heart is through with trusting
Your cheated heart is nothing new
A blank expression on a fuzzy screen
Tells me things couldn't get much worse
You say you're giving up on love
He ruined it for everyone
I wish I'd gotten there first
'Cause then you'd be feeling like a queen
And I'd be holding the girl of my dreams
I could help you mend your cheated heart"
Good Charlotte,The River,Good Morning Revival,01/04/2007,"As I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of L.A
The footsteps that were next to me
Have gone their separate ways
I've seen enough now to know that beautiful things
Don't always stay that way
I've done enough now to know this beautiful place
Isn't everything they say

I heard that evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels
I'm walking towards the light

Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life and I want to be delivered
In the city was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong but I swear I'm a believer
Like the prodigal son, I was out on my own
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I'm delivered, I'm delivered

You're from a small town, you're going to grow up fast
Underneath these lights
Down in Hollywood, on the boulevard
The dead come back to life
To the praying Mother and the worried Father
Let your children go
If they come back they'll come home stronger
And if they don't you'll know

They say that evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels
I'm walking towards the light

Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life and I want to be delivered
In the city was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong but I swear I'm a believer
Like the prodigal son, I was out on my own
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I'm delivered, I'm delivered

Baptized in the river (On my own)
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
On my own
On my own
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
I confess I'm a sinner
I've seen a vision of my life and I want to be delivered"

A Day to Remember,Monument,For Those Who Have Heart,01/22/2007,"It's Monday morning
And I would kill for a chance to drive
Get so far away from here with you my dear
That I'll never leave your side
Nobody knows the troubles I've seen
In a van, on a soapbox for the world to see

Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them

We're getting older
I've started to fear for my life
Is this the way that it should be?
This whole thing's riding on me
It's been a long road so far
With nowhere to turn
There's no looking back from here
No more dwelling on my fears

Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me

Come on

Here's a middle finger
Coming straight from OCA-L-A
I appreciate your judgement
It's proved that I can't trust a word you say
Those must be some pair of binoculars
That you see every move I make
So I'll never be a liar
But you'll always be two-faced

You'll get what's coming to you
You're blinded by your instincts
I'm not your fucking game
I'm not so easily beat

I'm looking down at this mess that you've made
And I can't believe that I stayed
So unhappy for so long
Where did I go wrong?
I've got to get out of this
My hand is on the handle
We're leaving everything behind
Goodbye for a lifetime

I'll rip that scandalous bitch in two
We'll bring the noise

Try to pretend that I never even knew your name
Cause everything you are disgusts me
(Too bad I can't turn back time)
So I wouldn't be here
What I'd give for you to disappear
So tell me girly how's your edge?

You've got nothing better to do
I know why you can't see straight
I thought you were better than this
But you're just like everyone else

I'm looking down at this mess that you've made
And I can't believe that I stayed
So unhappy for so long
Where did I go wrong?

Not too far from here
Out on the East Coast
Maybe it resides in you my dear
We're worn out on our courtesy
We've made our curtain calls
Like vampire bats deprived of blood
Into the New York City night we crawl
And you've got a funny way of showing off
Your bathroom surgery
You said you were just cooling down
From plans of leaving me
There's something I should tell you
For we may not have much time
I've never met arms like yours
The stars at night are big and bright
Deep in your eyes, Miss Vincent
You told me once I made you smile
We both know damn well I didn't
I'm not much of a jester
But I'd test poison food for you
Your majesty, you're royal blue
I'm loyalty, my king of pain
There's a hard rain falling
Flooding your attic, it's clear
Can't put out the fire
That resides in you, my dear
There's something I should tell you
For we may not have much time
I've never seen scars like yours

Always darker, emptier, and simpler

I just thank them for showing up at all
I have black periods. Who does not?
But they are not a part of me;
They are not a part of illness, but a part of my being
What am I saying?
I have the courage to have them
Four o' clock in the morning. This sucks.""

I can't go on
You set my head too heavy
I need that song
Those trusty chords could pull me through
And early on
They saw the warning signs and symptoms all day long
We'd sit and dream of better days

When we'd hit the ground running on empty
Stories we've been told
And all those nights we spent together
Never felt this fucking cold
When we let the car run in the driveway
Kiss you one last time
Before we brought the horses in before
The storm of '59, of '59

I can't go on
These limbs have grown too heavy
I need that song
A night on earth could pull me through
And early on
They saw the warning signs and symptoms all day long
Wonder how far from here we'll fall

Before we hit the ground running on empty
Stories we've been told
And those nights we spent together
Never felt this fucking cold
When we let the car run in the driveway
Kiss you one last time
Before we brought the horses in before

True blue
But the prince of any failing empire knows that
Everybody wants, everybody wants
To drive on through the night
If it's a drive back home

Things aren't the same anymore
Some nights, they get so bad
You almost pick up the phone

Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
You know, it's strange
It's a strange way of saying
That I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you

I've already given up on myself twice
Third time is the charm, third time is the charm
Threw caution to the wind
But I've got a lousy arm
And I've traced your shadows on the wall
Now I kiss them whenever I'm down
Whenever I'm down
Figured on not figuring myself out

Things aren't the same anymore
Some nights, they get so bad
I almost pick up the phone

Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
You know, it's strange
It's a strange way of saying
That I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you

Born under a bad sign, you saved my life
That night on the roof of your hotel
""Cross my heart and hope to die
Splintered from the headboard in my eye""
Photo-proofed kisses I remembered so well

Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns

Better off against worse for wear
And you're someone who knows someone
Who knows someone I once knew
And I just want to be a part of this
The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Hired a construction crew 'cause it's hell on the engine
And you are the dreamer and we are the dream
I could write it better than you ever felt it

So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

My words are my faith, to hell with our good name
A remix of your guts, your insides x-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
I love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
I could write it better than you ever felt it

So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu

A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part

Last summer we took threes across the board
But by fall, we were a cover story, ""Now in stores""
Make us poster boys for your scene
But we are not making an acceptance speech
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes
Every dot com's refreshing for a journal update

So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five

I can take your problems away with a nod and a wave...
Of my hand, 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am
The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the diehards

So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life
Fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts
Cry on the couch and all the poets come to life

They don't take a step
Line keeps on pushing

Was gone and it was raining

Now Saturday is cold and damp and
I left you all alone, I didn't talk at all

The way that I got no more to say
And the rest of you can say its right
But I don't trust a thing in sight
When everything is overrated
You're so good you just can't fake it
I waited for some kind of answer
Some kind words so that I can cold ya
I left you all alone
I didn't talk at all and now I feel so sad
I guess I just needed a day to feel lonely
Lonely and blue
Oh, how about you?
Well it was raining all day long
Well it was raining all day long
Well it was raining all day long
Well it was raining all day long
Punk Rock Millionaires with coke up their nose
Writing records in designer homes
But the rains kinda nice
And it's really all right if we don't talk at all
It's only one song!"

And i'm in trouble deep
Yeah i'm so tired
Not enough cash to keep me in vices
I can't think about it now
She's getting too close and i don't even like it
I can't think about it now
Always behind on the latest devices
I can't think about it now
Panic in the office
Record label crisis
I can't think about it now
So many words i like like to say to convince you i'll stay
So many words i'd like to say to convince you that i'm so tired
So many words that i'd love to get by this
But everyone's watching me
I'm out of disguises
And nobody know if the kids gonna like it
So c'mon and tell me
Don't think about all the things that you want
And the things that you need
Its only a matter of what you don't see
There's not enough cash
And there ain't enough vices
Couldn't think about it even if i tried to"

She's all books and quotations
And no fun and games

Don't you believe it
Don't you believe it
When its quiet and lights are low
You're the last one you want around
You're the last one to know
Cuz its over you know when I said
Its time to go now don't let things go to your head
Its over won't you come over

Lifetime,Just A Quiet Evening,Lifetime,02/06/2007,"Living at home
Living under one roof
Walls are raging
They're all crazy
Mind is racing
Say you left it far behind
And you'll always feel your 17
In a dream
Isn't it a sad thing that we all can't win?
You got your sad songs or the radio
It's for sure that you are all done
Just a quiet evening
Just a quiet evening
When you get home the street is quiet in the morning
And the sight of her is all you need to get so down
I can't figure how a letter so upset her just climb down the stairs
Just disappear
I can promise something fleeting
Just a quiet evening that will pass
And although we ain't got nothing to show
By sitting at home
It'd mean a lot to me
I can promise something fleeting
Just a quiet evening that will pass
Just a quiet evening
Just a quiet evening"

Almost time for us to go so won't you open up your door

I hope your in your car right now turning this shit up so loud
I hope your in the mood to tune into my favorite station
Across the nation it's a fact you ain't never coming back
Car is running out of gas push it up the overpass
You stayed inside to long so come along just come on you stayed away
Too long so i wrote for you this song

I never thought you'd only want me
I know he didn't want her
She didn't want him to
Stay around forever

And now your gone away for good
You fall in love but love has gone away
And now your gone away for good
You fall in love but love has gone
It's a funny little thing
And it gets inside your head
It's a killer round the corner
And all you really do is try and keep your cool
And wait till everything blows over
Leave it alone, leave it alone
Don't take your love away so soon
We could just play records at night
I know its been a long time"
Lifetime,Song For Mel,Lifetime,02/06/2007,"Oh it was so nice this towns a paradise
Sidewalks burning and so your locked inside your room
It's just a calm before the changing tide
It was so simple now theres things to sign
And someones always waiting round
With matches by their side
And someones sneaking in the office getting high
Oh Oh it's a common action
It's a perfect scene
Lets write about it in a magazine
Everyones so excited it's the next big thing
Just the latest chapter
It's a total dram"
Lifetime,Spiders In A Garden,Lifetime,02/06/2007,"You're standing on the street
You've thought of everything
I don't think it's overrated
I just wondered what the date was
You're standing on the street
New sneakers, everything
But no one broke the news
You wonder why you spend the night
Cars drive on by
It's the same old story
Please tell me I'm dreaming
I'll believe it when I see it
I do it for the right reasons, you'd have to agree
I just think you're too polite
You're wound so tight
You fuss and fight
Please tell me I gotta be wrong
But my heart is pounding too strong
You left so I went home
Go check your answers and get off the phone now
But you change direction
The garden's protection
And the moons just right
Take a look at the trees
Tell me what do you see
It's all for us
Don't get lost darling
Maybe it's something
Maybe it's not
We'll see, maybe
But it's all we got"

All night but I'm too tired and your uptite
I'm getting into something good
Like I knew I would
And the time it takes to bust that party
We can waste another night
Just sitting on the porch all night until the wine is through

You're lost so, so lonely
You'll never make it you phoney
The reason you told me
You'll never make it you phoney
Can i turn off your MODERN ROCK
Just hit the button make it stop
You're getting into something good, like i knew you would
You're calling on a static line
When all you want to feel is fine
And she's another reason why your always acting good

There's a reason why you feel so low and it's starting to show
Could you reach for the door I don't wanna stay here no more
I don't know how you missed it before
There's a reason you came here I'm sure
But you don't really know get your pants off the floor and go home
And go home
Just stay awake
But just don't let it get in your head
Don't let it get in your head"
Lifetime,Yeems Song For Nothing,Lifetime,02/06/2007,"So cool it down
Relax a while
You get too crazy
Quit holding out
On the couch
Your glass is nearly empty
But did you see it all come down
Along your race to ruin
No reason to talk now
No reason to talk
Quit making lists of all the stuff that you did
Just push on lightly and don't think about the stuff you hid
Your love has gone for good
Though he's still in the room
No more talk of future
I can't bare to lose you
At all the shows
Love comes and goes
And then you wonder, are we over exposed?
Don't wanna know
Your favorite show
All I wanted to know is
What time I could stop by
She don't know
She never knows
I saw it come down
When he blew into town
It was right on the corner
When you pulled her inside
They never know
They never know"
The Ataris,"Act V, Scene IV: And So It Ends Like It Begins",Welcome the Night,02/20/2007,"The smell of incense
It fills the air inside this room
Cast of light colorly strewn about the floor
A casket lined with pills
And the bitter taste of absinth
To wash it down
And so it ends like it began
At a cross
Along this interstate
A worn inscription
All cracked and faded
These actions will remain
When bodies turn to dust
And from this monument
I will drown inside the anguish of your heart
A new dawn broke this morning
Tears were raining in this room
As pure as holy water
Reflecting images of you
This world is like a whore
So ravish and so beautiful
So bitter cold and all alone
And if i had my way
We'd wake up on the day we met
I'd stare into your heart for hours
And try to make you hear the sweetest thoughts
But not tonight
We die inside each others arms
We'd revel in our last embrace
I'd steal the breath right from your heart
And kiss you as we die
I rest my lifeless head upon your heart
Forever
I rest my lifeless head upon your heart
Forever
I rest my lifeless head upon your heart
Forever
Maybe i'll bring you sunlight after all
I'm sorry
Maybe i'll bring you sunlight after all
I'm sorry
Maybe i'll bring sunlight after all
I'm sorry
Maybe i'll be sunlight after all
So sorry
Maybe i'll greet sunlight after all
I'm sorry
Maybe i'll greet sunlight after all"
The Ataris,Cardiff-by-the-Sea,Welcome the Night,02/20/2007,"The sea has become
Profoundly red as wine
The skies they bleed with fleeting passion tonight
Come sweet euphoria
Your light is blinding to me
You feel as comforting as a mother's warm embrace
But still you're just as lonely as the sea
We gaze out upon the crashing waves
From this hillside graveyard masquerade
Sweet terrible angel
Embrace my soul with light
Is it honesty that sunk my lungs and is dying to get out
But still I'm helpless as an orphaned child
Can you cure this loneliness in my heart
My heart
Can you cure this loneliness in my heart
In my heart
Euphoria, euphoria
Euphoria, euphoria
Euphoria, euphoria"
The Ataris,New Years Day,Welcome the Night,02/20/2007,"You're a senior double major
You got such big ideas
We were searching for a savior
To guide us through those restless years
If only I could steal you away
From those paths we were led astray
I would take back all those things I said
That new year's day
If only I could make you see
That all those dreams belonged to me
I'd take back all those things I said
That new year's day
The October autumn twilight
The chilling of our breath
I had dreams I've found redemption
And a past full of regret
And the clouds on the horizon
Look like a thousand paper cranes
And I heard your voice
But couldn't scream your name
If only I could steal you away
From those paths were led astray
I would take back all those things I said
That new year's day
If only I could make you see
That all those dreams belonged to me
I'd take back all those things I said
That new year's day
So let's drink to forgiveness
Let's drink for regret
Let's drink to the ones we've loved and lost
Let us never forget
The mannequin shields her glowing eyes
We'll all too human, yeah
We're always searching on
Until that gift of isolation has been won
If only I could steal you away
From those paths were led astray
I would take back all those things I said
That new year's day
If only I could make you see
That all those dreams belonged to me
I'm haunting them the way you know you're haunting me
If only I could steal you away
From those paths were led astray
I would take back all those things I said
That new year's day
That new year's day"
The Ataris,Not Capable of Love,Welcome the Night,02/20/2007,"Beneath the glow of this hanging moon
Lies a city still and cold
Our silhouettes walk hand in hand
The drunken jukebox serenade
We pretend we're so innocent
Cause no one ever likes to hurt
Go take off that silver dress
And expose your naked heart
I'm not capable of love
That kind of love
That I felt when I was twenty one
Cause I'm not capable of love
That kind of love
That I felt when I was twenty one
Take it back
So happy birthday darling
Watch those candles melt away
Not unlike those chandeliers
At the bar where we both etched our names
Who would have thought we'd fall so hard
Who would have thought we'd fall so fast
Optimistic children
Clinging tight to all we never had
I'm not capable of love
That kind of love
That I felt when I was twenty one
Cause I'm not capable of love
That kind of love
Could I wish that I could take back
Take it back
You're the only one I want
I wish that I could take it back
Am I not capable of love
That kind of love
That I felt when I was twenty one
Cause I'd be right if I said
You're not my biggest regret
Could I wish that I could take it back
Cause I'm not capable of love
That kind of love
That I felt when I was twenty one
Take it back"
The Ataris,The Cheyenne Line,Welcome the Night,02/20/2007,"In silence, I like to think out loud
You say this is the end
I know it's not the end
I took a picture
Of heaven when we broke down
Across the Cheyenne Line
I never will forget
The color of last night
Over us
We missed the point in living
So caught up in this moment
We threw out all convictions
And traded them for substance
This life you hold so near
Will fade in time...
And so it goes
No we won't let go
If you are alive
Then be truly alive
Just open up your eyes
Pay attention to the signs
The color of the sky in this night
We missed the point in living
So caught up in this moment
We threw out all convictions
And traded them for substance
This life we hold so dear
Will fade in...
Time spend wasted on a lie
It's time you found some frame of mind
This life you hold so near
Will fade in time
We missed the point in living
So caught up in this moment
We threw out all convictions
And traded them for substance
This life we hold so dear
Will fade in time
And so it goes
No we won't let go
And so it goes
No no you won't let go
This life you hold so dear
Will fade in time..."
The Ataris,Welcome the Night,Welcome the Night,02/20/2007,"Can we understand life
And live it at the same time
Where is this purpose you speak of?
I'll be the background of this photograph
The soundtrack to this night
And we are fading out, before our eyes
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
In heaven so wonderful
Why are we oh so afraid of dying young
We are dying young
We are the patterns and the shapes
The patchwork from the window on this place
We are alone, alone, alone
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
This television set, it burns my eyes
And there is no one here
That can keep me warm tonight
Where is this purpose
Where is the lie, the lie, the lie
Close your eyes and welcome in the night
Close your eyes and welcome in the night"
Good Charlotte,Break Apart Her Heart,Good Morning Revival,03/27/2007,"When you call she doesn't answer
When you write she doesn't answer
You go out you see him with her
She told you she was sick at home
The ring you gave her
Thrown away with all the letters
And when you see him with her
He doesn't even care at all
And she follows him around like you follow her around
And he doesn't even care and you figure it out
The only way you're going to keep somebody around
Well I'm about to let you know

There's something I don't want to understand
The only way a woman's going to want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she's the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you've got to give
If you want to keep the girl for as long as you live
Just break it apart her heart

Can't you see the way she's crying
Well that's what keeps her trying
She knew that she could have you
And he don't give her what she wants
There's truth about this
You say you want to be noticed
Well if you want to be noticed
You got to learn to break some hearts
Don't try to understand

There's something I don't want to understand
The only way a woman's going to want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she's the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you've got to give
If you want to keep the girl for as long as you live
Just break it apart her heart

Can you see
What you've done
What I've become
What I've become
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
I don't understand this cruelty
I don't understand but now I see

There's something I don't want to understand
The only way a woman's going to want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she's the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you've got to give
If you want to keep the girl for as long as you live
Just break it apart her heart

I don't understand it's just not me

You carry Dior bags

You wear Louis Vuitton, HG, and YSL
Now I got Bathing Ape
I got DCMA
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain
I got a model 26
But she stays in her place
I got a Kershaw neatly
Tucked inside in my waist

And the record keeps playing
The same old song
The hipster mean mugging on me all night long
They say ""Ah ha, ah ha""
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl
They say ""Ah ha, ah ha""
But the record keeps playing
The same old song
They say ""Ah ha, ah ha""
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl

Now she sweating my friends
And my hurricane shoes
She likes the records I spin
My Adam Barton tattoos
But she can't say ""what's up""
So what does she do
She just stays posted up
The other side of the room
I got AMC tattooed on my hand
I got Black Wall Street on a black bandana

Me, me, I don't want to fight about it
I just want to be up out it
I'm just trying to stay up out it
Step out the wagon
You know the boy starts to hate
The girl that came with him
They like that's not the boy she dates
They get to fighting and swearing
And now the boyfriend is staring
The disco ball on the ceiling
Looks like the chain that I'm wearing
But the music keeps playing
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain
I got brass knuckles hanging
From my neck in my chain

And the record keeps playing
The same old song

Sum 41,Underclass Hero,Underclass Hero,05/15/2007,"(One, two, three, four...)

Well, I won't be caught living in a dead-end job
While praying to my government, guns, and God
Now it's us against them, we're here to represent
And spit right in the face of the establishment

And now I don't believe (in having faith in nothing)
Stand on my own (and got no sympathy)
Wasting the youth (while being young and useless)
Speak for yourself (and don't pray for me)

Well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you
'Cause we'll be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold
Just like you

(A call across the Underclass)
Calling out loud with no respect
I'm not the one, I'm just another reject
I'm the voice to offend all those who pretend
Unsung against the grain, I'm here to rise against

Now I'm desensitized (I state my place in nowhere)
Burning the flag (of the degeneration)
Everyone sing (the anthem of no future)
Down with the mass ('cause we're not listening)

Well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you
'Cause we'll be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold
Just like you

May I have your attention please?
I pledge allegiance to the Underclass
As your hero at large!

(One, two, three, four...)
We're the saints of degeneration
We don't owe anyone an explanation

I do, I still think of you when we dance
Although we can't jitterbug as we did then

Do you remember when
How long has it been?
1945, you opened my blue eyes
To see a whole new life
Do you remember when
I told you this that night?
That if you're by my side
When every day begins
I'll fall for you again
I made a promise when
I told you this that night

I'll be fine
Cause when i die, then i die loving you
It's alright, i'll be fine
When i die then i die loving you
Loving you, loving you

Do you remember the times we would give up on each other then get back together
Then we finally was married in 1949
We drove the yellow convertible on our honeymoon
Do you remember? I do

Life has led us here
Together all these years
This house that we have made
Holds 20,000 days
The memories we've saved
Since life has led us here


I'm coming home to you
Slipping off my shoes
Resting in my chair
I see you standing there
The silver in your hair
I'm coming home to you
When i lay tonight
When i close my eyes
I know the sun will rise
Here or the next life
As long as you're still mine, then it's alright


You have grey hair now
But you are a beautiful woman
And the years have been good to both of us

I've become the victimized now, desensitized now

I pay for all the bad things I've done

(Where'd I go wrong?) Something's wrong because I
Find the glamour in the dark side, in the dark side
(Where'd I go wrong?) Cheap regrets, can't forget
Falling victim to the debts still, unpaid in my mind

The one and only day has come
I pay for all the bad things I've done

It's going to take me, you don't know tragedy
I've been to hell and back again to tell and
Close my eyes and lay me down to sleep
I fear the worst, my beating heart ticks to explode
And my time is up so
Why can't I just lie?
Living dead awake, the horror show begins
So pull the curtains over me

It's a free-for-all kill them all, every last one of them

Drown the thoughts that have me confined

Gutter dreams as black as the night

No one told me empathy's a lie

Suffocate the dreams in my mind
(I can't stop believing)

And paid your price, and sealed your fate within

I've been waiting for the chance to reunite this increment
Poison never hurt so good
So nice of you to speak of me, your closest friend and enemy
And only saviour of masochists

Well, it's the dead-end, slave
From the altar to the grave
It's the last days of our life and faith, amen

Time, it's been so long and now there's nothing to say
I'm trying so hard to find the words to say
I'm tired of being, now I'm something I'm not
I can't believe and I never thought

Days would come to an end
Well maybe someday we'll meet again
If ever that day never comes it would be too soon, my love

I've been waiting for the chance to nullify this increment
Pull the chord to detonate
So sick of you don't speak of me, no represent of misery

Satisfaction guaranteed a pill away catastrophe
On a mission, nowhere bound, inhibitions underground
A shallow grave I have dug all by myself

Started making his way past 2 in the morning
He hasn't been sober for days
Leaning now into the breeze
Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees
They had breakfast together
But two eggs don't last
Like the feeling of what he needs

Now this place seems familiar to him
She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
Left him dying to get in

Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

And even though she doesn't believe in love
He's determined to call her bluff
Who could deny these butterflies?
They're filling his gut
Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
He pleads, though he tries
But he's only denied
Now he's dying to get inside

Funny how it rained all day
I didn't think much of it then
But it's starting to all make sense
Oh, I can see now that all of these clouds
Are following me in my desperate endeavor
To find my whoever, wherever she may be

I'm not coming back (forgive me)
I've done something so terrible
I'm terrified to speak (I'm not calling, I'm not calling)
But you'd expect that from me
I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt, now the rain is just (You're driving me crazy, I'm)
Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
Keeping an eye on the world
From so many thousands of feet off the ground
I'm over you now, I'm at home in the clouds
And towering over your head

Well I guess I'll go home now
I guess I'll go home now
I guess I'll go home now

And that won't happen to me

Whoa
No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoa
And we won't come back, the world is calling out
Whoa
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company
Well, so long, you'll miss me when I'm gone

Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
When I'm gone
Let's go!

Won't look back
When I say goodbye
I'm gonna leave this hole behind me
Gonna take what's mine tonight
'Cause every wasted day becomes a wasted chance
You're gonna wake up feeling sorry
'Cause life won't wait
I guess it's up to you

Whoa
No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoa
And we won't come back, the world is calling out
Whoa
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company
Well, so long, you'll miss me when I'm gone

Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh

Saves the Day,Can't Stay The Same,Under the Boards,10/30/2007,"Go, if you want to go
Don't want to lie here while you cry yourself to sleep
Say what you want to say
'Cause I can see by your face that something's not the Same
Hey hey everything's okay
I love you more than I can say
But we can't stay the same
Yeah
Do what you want to do
Don't want to keep you here holding so tight you can't breathe
Stay not another minute stay
'Cause I don't think I want to live here dying all alone
Hey hey everything's okay
I love you more than I can say
But we can't stay the same
Yeah
Well I've been thinking about the words I've said before
When I was locked outside and pounding on the door
I wish I said I'm sorry sweetheart I can't be
The man I lead you to believe that I would be
Somewhere deep inside I know something's wrong
I know you're never safe around me anymore
Hey hey everything's okay
I love you more than I can say
But we can't stay the same
Yeah"
Jimmy Eat World,Always Be,Chase This Light,12/03/2007,"Could've been a night like any other
One of us has to drive
One of us gets to think
I'll force a laugh to break the silence
It's gonna get harder still
Before it gets easy
You can't keep safe what wants to break

I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's all lost in this
She's all like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach

I was just a boy like every other
I thought I was something fierce
I thought I was ten times smarter
Love would be something that I just know
(Something I just know)
How you gonna know the feeling 'til you've lost it
I've been losing plenty since

I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's all lost in this
She's all like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach

Maybe something else I'm missing
Something good and you're the reason
It's a dream but there's a real world waiting

I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's all lost in this
She's all like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach"

You'll never remember, your head is far too blurry
Put him in the back of a squad car, restrain that man
He needs his head put through a cat scan
Hey editor, I'm undeniable
Hey Doctor, I'm certifiable

Oh, I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I'm half doomed and you're semi-sweet

Perfect boys

Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy

Or was that just a telescopic camera nod
Painted dolls in the highway, truck stop stalls
Lot lizards scales cool my nightlife moods

I've been sitting, I've been thinking
Man it's been so hard to cope
And I took your stupid pictures from off of the mantle shelf
But I can't erase your voices from my head
Is it too soon because..
Remember when I told you that we couldn't work it out?
Remember when I told you all about these stupid doubts?
Well I wrote 1000 letters couldn't send a single one
Telling you that I have changed my mind
And you won't let me get you off my mind..
What can I do?
It hurts like hell but hell, what can I do?
It's been a couple weeks and still I've gotten no reply
I've been sitting, contemplating, forcing myself not to cry
And I can't help but think that everything has gone all wrong
And I miss hearing you tell me ""it's alright""
Is it too soon because..
Remember when I told you that we couldn't work it out?
Remember when I told you all about these stupid doubts?
Well I wrote 1000 letters couldn't send a single one
Telling you that I have changed my mind
And you won't let me get you off my mind..
What can I do?
It hurts like hell but hell, what can I do?
You've got a lot of problems
And I'd love to help you out
But my train leaves at 1:30 and its 1:28 now..
I'm burning all your pictures
No thanks for the memories
DON'T FORGET TO LOSE MY NUMBER AND REMEMBER TO FORGET IT NOW!"

I know that
I knew that before it even was

I'm not the only fool around

I have desperate leaning
Oh oh, feeling like I'm seeing things...
It's not my fault, I love you so
It wasn't my wish for you to let me go
I promise that I'll try to keep this cool
Tell me though, must you be so Beautiful?
Your lover
How is he?
Does he do it just the way you want to?
What happens when he's busy?
Do you get lonely when he doesn't want you?
It drives me crazy when you tell me that you really wanna be
Just my chum...
Ive got a bottle fully of healthy dripping love and you won't even try some
Oh oh, quick, phone the asylum
It's not my fault, I love you so
It wasn't my wish for you to let me go
I promise that I'll try to keep this cool
Tell me though, must you be so Beautiful?
I can handle your sweet voice
On the telephone line
I can handle your beat choice
To leave me alone, Fine!
I can handle the fact you said you'd found me rather dull
But must you be so mercilessy Beautiful??
Its over

And in time, those days might make their way back
I won't hold my breath
There were times where we were stupid kids
And it was all a game
But as for now, this is the best night of my life
And if you were here
I know you'd love it so
I wish you were here
Because i love you so
And these are things i often think about
But it's a waste of time
'cause you're not here
I'm not sober
It's not 1999
And these are things i often think about
But it's all in the past

And the subject matters more than I can stand
But I can't seem to ever put it down
She's the queen of my dreams but unfortunately she's M.I.A
And I'm clueless as to where she could be
And I wrote this letter 1000 times to you
But there's nowhere to send it to
Where the hell are you?
Take me to the skyway
I'm sure that Westerberg would say
I'm Feeling Minneapolis again..."

The whole way through
Was by a band that had formed
In 1982
I was barely alive
I had some thinking to do
But once I figured it out
I was in love and I knew that I
Would be in love forever
The last girl that I loved
She kind of looked like you
She had a beat up guitar
And an awesome tattoo
But she was breaking my heart
I had some learnin' to do
And once I figured it out
I was in love and I knew that I
Would be in love forever
Well I, would be in love forever
I wish I could get you to call me
I wish that you would stand here beside me
But I will never be with you
I wish my mind would trip to way back when
You were a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend
Life is long when you're lonely
Life is long when you're lonely
The last album I loved
The whole way through
Was by a band that had formed
In 1982
I was barely alive
I had some learnin' to do
But once I figured it out
I was in love and I knew that I
Would be in love forever

They tore down the innocent wonders of my youth

I remember when bears used to live there
Indians in tepees sent out signals with a rug
And it's like I always say you know?
And it's like I always say you know?
Things used to be so big (and I used to feel so small)
Things used to be so new (when did they get so old?)
Things used to be so... Better
My father used to work in asbestos
Now I'm not exactly sure what he does with his time
His kids are all grown up now
I'll bet he's wondering what happened to all that time
And it's like I always say you know?

Sometimes I can't let go
Last night, I had a dream
Only I would understand
Vast lands of confusion
I visit every time, clawing through my gut
And when you think about it
It seems so inevitable
That this time I'm right
About a lot of things
It hurts so much to be wrong
Sometimes I don't feel like being close
Sometimes I can't let go
Knife-like hugs feeling warm and sharp
That's not a devil in my arms
Years go by between the first and the last
Standing still in the immediate past
Knife-like hugs feeling warm and sharp

Where nothing's what it seems

I'm giving you the creeps
And a farewell kiss to go
Into the unknown
Saw you standing there
Outside the music hall
You come out for some air
A certain curtain call
And everyone just stared
When you took the stage that night
Something's not right
You're up there, took the stairs to the stars all alone
You left all the lights burning but nobody's home
I believe they deceived your tuneful heart too long
And they sing along

Help me, help me, won't you?
Sing me, sing me one last song
Help me, help me, somebody help me
Save me from myself
Here I'll find you in between
Heaven and hell again
Where nothing's what it seems
It's just as well my friend
I'm giving me the creeps
And a farewell to arms, and legs, and heads and heart
You're up there, took the stairs to the stars all alone
You left all the lights burning but nobody's home
I believe they deceived your tuneful heart too long
Now they sing along

Help me, help me won't you?
Sing me, sing me one last song
Help me, help me, somebody help me
Save me from myself
Take me from this hell

I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why? All the possibilities
Well, I was wrong

That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
Cause I burned every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities
I'm sure you've heard

That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey!

Why do we like to hurt so much?
Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
Now, I can't trust myself with anything but this
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa"

Fucking up until we get this right
Just 'cause we're down, doesn't mean we've gotta stay there

We've been sinking all along

Pulling me closer, pushing away
And me, the sharpest thorn on your vine
Twisting and turning, we're all intertwined
Broken wing
Empty glass
Words that scream and bounce right back

And mend where you are broken

The setting sun destroys the light

Cutting each other without even knowing

And I am in her rain

Turns all by itself

Beyond slings and arrows

You'll make it better
Shake it off
It never mattered anyway

If we don't make it alive
Well, it's a hell of a good day to die
All our light that shines strong
Only lasts for so long
And it's ashes to ashes again
Should we even try to pretend?
All our light that shines strong
Only lasts for so long

Is burning and red
It's blocking the sunlight
That shines overhead
You against the world
Diamonds and pearls
Voices inside you churn
Watch the city burn
Your own liberation
Will leave them behind
All the slings and arrows
That rain on your mind
Don't make it better
Break it cause

Way back, when we were just kids

I knew that somebody did

Oh, waves of time
Seem to wash away the scenes of our crimes
For you, this never ends

Can you stay strong? Can you go on?
Kristy, are you doing okay?
A rose that won't bloom, winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away

Though the marks on your dress had been neatly repressed
I knew that something was wrong
And I should've spoke out, and I'm so sorry now
I didn't know, 'cause we were so young

Oh, clouds of time
Seem to rain on innocence left behind
It never goes away

Can you stay strong? Can you go on?
Kristy, are you doing okay?

All the damage done to your name and your keepsakes
Only just begun, it's been fun, we were blind, deaf and dumb
There's a party in my closet, calling all skeletons
Calling all skeletons

Where did you go once the lights went black?
Look what's become of me
I've grown to love your disappearing acts
Do one more, pretty please

Now the time has come, I just wish I could erase

Where did you go once the lights went black?
Look what's become of me
I've grown to love your disappearing acts
Do one more, pretty please

And to tell you the truth I lost my faith in you
You've gotta stop sneaking off on me
And these unspoken lies appear at the worst times
You've gotta stop sneaking off on me
They're hiding just behind your eyes

Where did you go once the lights went black?
Look what's become of me
I've grown to love your disappearing acts
Do one more, pretty please

Where did you go once the lights went black?
You nearly gave us a heart attack
We thought you might have swam out to sea
You gotta stop sneaking off on me"

Seeping in like a feeling
You haven't felt since way back when
In the dead of that night, like the summer of Sam
I caught word of the commotion you caused via telegram
And got all worked up
We got all worked up
I found away
Over the fear and through the flames
I'm diving in, don't follow me
Stay right here, I'll be back for you someday
I found away
It'd be best if you just stayed
It's not safe, don't follow me
I found away, I found away
Frozen in the lights of a locomotive
Tied to the tracks again
You said you haven't felt this comatose
Since you can't remember when
Fly off the handle every time we sleep
Straight off the deep
I found away
Over the fear and through the flames
I'm diving in, don't follow me
Stay right here, I'll be back for you someday
I found away
It'd be best if you just stayed
It's not safe, don't follow me
I found away, I found away
From the top of my lungs
The truth shall be sung
Sharp and damning
Violently stabbing at secrecy
That look on your face
It's more than I can take
It's scaring
The living hell straight out of me
I found away
Over the fear and through the flames
I'm diving in, don't follow me
Stay right here, I'll be back for you someday

Run for cover as fast as you can
Where fighters are lovers, enemies are friends
And pens and knives apologize for leaving you tonight
For leaving you tonight

Please tell my wife I loved her more than life itself.""
""Over and out,"" she sang, as the telephone rang
""There's no pain, no answering no more, no.""


Run for cover and you'll find us there
To take on the anguish, make it disappear
When hand grenades and napalm flames are leaving you tonight
Let this candle burn 'til you get home
Never forget your face, never lose hope
Tonight...

Run for cover and you'll find us there (Over and out)
To take on the anger, make it disappear (Over and out)
When razor blades were softly serenading you"

I'm just a racehorse on the track
Send me back to the glue factory
Always thought I'd float away
And never come back
But I've got enough miles on my card
To fly the boys home on my own
But you know me: I like being all alone
And keeping you all alone
And the charts are boring
And the kids are snoring
And my egos in a sling
You say you're not listening and I said I'm wishing
And I said... I said"
Fall Out Boy,27,Folie ' Deux,12/16/2008,"If home is where the heart is, then we're all just fucked
I can't remember, I can't remember
And I want it so bad, I'd shoot the sunshine into my veins
I can't remember the good old days

And it's kind of funny
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored aboard
Just feels like a curse

My mind is a safe, and if I keep it, then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage, we take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat off last night's stage
Just to feel like you

The m-m-milligrams in my head burning tobacco in the wind
Chasing the direction, chasing the direction you went
You're a bottled star, the planets align, you're just like Mars
You shine in the sky, you shine in the sky

Are all the good times getting gone?
They come and go and go and come and go, oh yeah
I've got a lot of friends who are stars
But some are just black holes

My mind is a safe, and if I keep it, then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage, we take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat off last night's stage
Just to feel like you

NOFX,Creeping Out Sara,Coaster,01/01/2009,"I was backstage at a festival in Germany
Talking to a cute, fair-skinned brunette
I asked her if she wanted to have a beer
And if she liked our set
I noticed that her hair was longer in the back
I figured that's cause she's Canadian
That's why I was surprised when she told me she was fully lesbian
That's when I realized it was Sara
Or maybe it was Tegan
I'm pretty sure that it was Sara
Cause Johnny Samson said she was the cool one
I told her that I was a big fan of her band
She asked me if I had a favourite song
I admitted that I never actually heard them
But I like K.D. Lang
I told her this Jew knows about the Junos
And how they got robbed three times in a row
And then I asked her if she knew of anyone
Who's selling pills or blow
That's when I creeped out Sara
Or maybe I just pissed her
Off when I asked her if her sister
And her had ever had a threesome
Where they both ganged up on one girl
A fourgy or a fivesome
Do they think strap-ons are groovy
And had they ever seen the movie
""Bound"", and did they like Jennifer Tilly?
Did they like Jennifer Tilly?
Sara said she
Preferred Gina Gershon
Angelina Jolie
In that ""Gia"" movie
That was on HBO
And ""If These Walls Could Talk""
Made Tegan cry alot
After that I almost forgot what she said
That's the problem with Diazepam
So many things I don't remember
But I got a sinking feeling
It's not that I'm a clair-
-voyant but I think I creeped out Sara
I was creeping out on Sara
I hope it wasn't Tegan
Cause Skiba said she is the cooler one"

Eddie broke it off with Paul

A Day to Remember,Another Song About the Weekend,Homesick,02/03/2009,"They keep playing sad songs on the radio
And I feel like I'm so alone
On this 15-hour drive
And all the while I tell myself to just believe
Cause nobody can give so much
And never get anything

Says they don't know what I've become
But I'm still the same
Not much has changed
I still know where I came from

The Florida sun begs me to come back home
And it feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me

And I can't remember what it's like to find meaning in anything
For the life of me

Everyone I used to know
Says they don't know what I've become

Not much has changed
I still know where I came from

NOFX,We Called It America,Coaster,04/28/2009,"""The leads are weak.""
""The leads are weak; fucking leads are weak? You're weak.""

Remember when America had a middle class and an upper class?
That was way before the exodus
That was the America that we thought was number one
Thought would overcome, thought would never die
That was just our pride and faith: two shitty deadly sins;
I know faith isn't one of 'em but it should have been
Cause when things were crumbling, we had no camaraderie
Just a faith someone would save us from despondence

We called it America, whoa
We called it America, whoa

""Number one America"" was a slogan used
To keep morale up when we knew we were already cooked
Then the richer western states
Succeeded in secession and the eastern ones followed right behind
Mexi-Can-America was the perfect name
That epitomized the order of significance, authority and affluence
We had turned it all around, went from number one, straight to number two (shit)

National bankruptcy, circumcised society
USA, dined and ditched;
Fox reports ""poor is the new rich""

National bankruptcy, circumcised society

Green Day,21st Century Breakdown,21st Century Breakdown,05/15/2009,"Born into Nixon, I was raised in hell
A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled
The last one born and the first one to run
My town was blind from refinery sun

My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero

21st century breakdown
I once was lost but never was found
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline

I was made of poison and blood
Condemnation is what I understood
Video games of the tower's fall
Homeland security could kill us all

My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero

21st century breakdown
I once was lost but never was found
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline



We are the class of, the class of '13
Born in the year of humility
We are the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 1969

My name is no one, the long lost son
Born on the 4th of July
Raised in the era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive
I am a nation, a worker of pride
My debt to the status quo
The scars on my hands are a means to an end
It's all that I have to show

I swallowed my pride and I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers and lied through my teeth
The pillar of damage control
I've been to the edge and I've thrown the bouquet
Of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room wasting my time
And waiting for judgement day

I praise liberty
""The Freedom to Obey,""
It's the song that strangles me
Well, don't cross the line


Oh, dream, America, dream
I can't even sleep from the light's early dawn
Oh, scream, America, scream
Believe what you see from heroes and cons"

Your confession will be crucified
You're a sacrificial suicide
Like a dog that's been sodomized, well
(Stand up!) All the white boys
(Sit down!) And the black girls
(Stand up!) You're the soldiers
(Sit down!) Of the new world

Put your faith in a miracle
And it's non-denominational
Join the choir, we'll be singing
In the church of wishful thinking

A fire burns, today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Oh, bless me, Lord, for I have sinned
It's been a lifetime since I last confessed
I threw my crutches in ""the river of a shadow of doubt""
And I'll be dressed up in my Sunday best

Say a prayer for the family
Drop a coin for humanity
Ain't this uniform so flattering?
I never asked you a goddamn thing!

A fire burns, today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Don't test me
Second-guess me
Protest me
You will disappear

I want to know who's allowed to breed
All the dogs who never learned to read
Missionary politicians
And the cops of the new religion

A fire burns, today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the inside

I'm here to honor you

You can rest
Assured that all my love's for you

Look out to the setting sun, the brink of your vision
Eternal youth is a landscape of a lie
The cracks of my skin can prove, as the years will testify
Say your prayers and light a fire, we're gonna start a war
Your slogan's a gun for hire, it's what we waited for
Hey, Gloria, this is why we're on the edge
The fight of our life's been drawn to this undying love

Gloria! Viva la Gloria!
You blast your name in graffiti on the walls
Falling through broken glass that's slashing through your spirit
I can hear it like a jilted crowd
Gloria! Where are you, Gloria?
You found a home in all your scars and ammunition
You made your bed in salad days amongst the ruins
Ashes to ashes of our youth

She smashed her knuckles into winter (Gloria!)
As autumn's wind fades into black
She is the saint of all the sinners (Gloria!)
The one that's fallen through the cracks
So don't put away your burning light!

Gloria! Where are you, Gloria?
Don't lose you faith to your lost naivety
Weather the storm and don't look back on last November
When your banners were burning down
Gloria! Viva la Gloria!
Send me your amnesty down to the broken hearted
Bring us the season that we always will remember
Don't let the bonfires go out!

So, Gloria, send out your message of
The light that shadows in the night
Gloria, where's your undying love?
Tell me the story of your life
Your life!"
Green Day,Viva la Gloria? (Little Girl),21st Century Breakdown,05/15/2009,"Little girl, little girl, why are you crying?
Inside your restless soul, your heart is dying
Little one, little one, your soul is purging
Of love and razor blades, your blood is surging

Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the Salvation Army
There is no place like home when you got no place to go

Little girl, little girl, your life is calling
The charlatans and saints of your abandon
Little one, little one, the sky is falling
Your lifeboat of deception is now sailing
In the wake, all the way, no rhyme or reason
Your bloodshot eyes will show your heart of treason
Little girl, little girl, you dirty liar
You're just a junkie preaching to the choir

Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the Salvation Army
There is no place like home when you got no place to go

The traces of blood always follow you home
Like the mascara tears from your getaway (Gloria!)
You're walking with blisters and running with shears
So unholy, sister of grace

Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the salvation army
There is no place like home..."

When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?


When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I"

One stupid call and I end up alone

Paramore,Feeling Sorry,brand new eyes (Deluxe Version),09/29/2009,"We still live in the same town, well, don't we?
But I don't see you around anymore
I go to all the same places, not even a trace of you
Your days are numbered at twenty-four
And I'm getting bored waiting 'round for you
We're not getting any younger, and I
Won't look back 'cause there's no use
It's time to move forward!

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

Well, I tried not to think of what might happen
When your reality, it finally cuts through
Well, as for me, I got out and I'm on the road
The worst part is that this (this), this could be you
You know it too, you can't run from your shame
You're not getting any younger
Time keeps passing by, but you wave it away
It's time to roll over

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

And all the best lies
They are told with fingers tied
So cross them tight
Won't you promise me tonight
If it's the last thing you do, you'll get out

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time, got no time
I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time
I've got no time for feeling sorry
I've got no time for feeling sorry"

Well, I guess I'll make my own way
It's a circle, a mean cycle
I can't excite you anymore
Where's your gavel? Your jury?
What's my offense this time?
You're not a judge, but if you're gonna judge me
Well, sentence me to another life

Don't wanna hear your sad songs
I don't wanna feel your pain
When you swear it's all my fault
'Cause you know we're not the same
We're not the same
Oh, we're not the same
Yeah, the friends who stuck together
We wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept that the change is good
It's good, it's good

Well, you treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
I guess I'll go
I'd best be on my way out
You treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
I guess I'll go

Ignorance is your new best friend
Ignorance is your new best friend

This is the best thing that could have happened
Any longer and I wouldn't have made it
It's not a war, no, it's not a rapture
I'm just a person, but you can't take it
The same tricks that, that once fooled me
They won't get you anywhere
I'm not the same kid from your memory
Well, now I can fend for myself

Don't wanna hear your sad songs
I don't wanna feel your pain
When you swear it's all my fault
'Cause you know we're not the same
We're not the same

Paramore,Misguided Ghosts,brand new eyes (Deluxe Version),09/29/2009,"I'm going away for a while
But I'll be back, don't try and follow me
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible
See, I'm trying to find my place
But it might not be here where I feel safe
We all learn to make mistakes

And run from them, from them
With no direction
We'll run from them, from them
With no conviction

'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Traveling endlessly
Don't need no roads
In fact, they follow me
And we just go in circles

Well, now I'm told that this is life
And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it
Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds
So I can find someone to rely on

And run to them, to them
Full speed ahead
Oh, you are not useless
We are just

Misguided ghosts
Traveling endlessly
The ones we trusted the most
Pushed us far away
And there's no one road
And we should not be the same
But I'm just a ghost
And still they echo me
They echo me in circles"
Paramore,Playing God,brand new eyes (Deluxe Version),09/29/2009,"Can't make my own decisions
Or make any with precision
Well, maybe you should tie me up
So I don't go where you don't want me
You say that I been changing
That I'm not just simply aging
Yeah, how could that be logical?
Just keep on cramming ideas down my throat
Woah

You don't have to believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
And break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

If God's the game that you're playing
Well, we must get more acquainted
Because it has to be so lonely
To be the only one who's holy
It's just my humble opinion
But it's one that I believe in
You don't deserve a point of view
If the only thing you see is you
Woah

You don't have to believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
And break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

This is the last second chance
(I'll point you to the mirror)
I'm half as good as it gets
(I'll point you to the mirror)
I'm on both sides of the fence
(I'll point you to the mirror)
Without a hint of regret
I'll hold you to it

I know you don't believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
And break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

Paramore,The Only Exception,brand new eyes (Deluxe Version),09/29/2009,"When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But, darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know, somewhere
Deep in my soul, that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone, but keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't, let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing"
Paramore,Turn It Off,brand new eyes (Deluxe Version),09/29/2009,"I scraped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my safest haven, seems like
It's getting harder to believe in anything
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts

I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
I'll turn it off
In all my spite
In all my spite
I'll turn it off

And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

The tragedy, it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to break and bending
We're taking shortcuts and false solutions
Just to come out the hero

Well, I can see behind the curtain (I can see, yeah yeah)
The wheels are cranking, turning
It's all wrong the way we're working
Towards a goal that's non existent
It's non existent, but we just keep believing

And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
I'll turn it off
In all my spite
In all my spite
I'll turn it off
Just turn it off
Again
Again, again

And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

There is nothing though there was a time
I had felt elation before all sensation died
I cannot breathe, I can't deny
That I've been feigning for you
Every vital sign defied
This means nothing to me
This means nothing, so spare me the lies
I deny you sympathy just as I have been denied
I cannot breathe, I can't deny
That I've been faking for you
Every sign of life
I died for the last lie
And the heartbreak for the first time
I could not take, I could not take
'Til I made you cry
This is what you taught me
This is what you taught and I learned well
To recognize that feeling easily can be dispelled
I cannot breathe, I can't deny
That I've been faking for you
Every sign of life
I died for the last lie
And the heartbreak for the first time
I could not take
For the last lie
And the heartbreak for the first time
I could not take 'til I made you
Show your wounds, I'm bored with mine
Nothing is new
Don't despair I rarely cry
Oh my, oh my dear, please dry your eyes
Who could harm you?
To hurt you is to be despised, as I'd love to
For the last lie
And the heartbreak for the first time
I could not take
For the last lie
And the heartbreak for the first time
I could not take 'til I made you cry

NOFX,Cokie The Clown,The Longest EP,11/24/2009,"All the way from Palm Springs, just out of detox
Show him a warm welcome, let's give some applause

Greetings all, hello
Welcome to my show
I'm sure you'll have fun
Watching me juggle
Eight balls at one time
I'm no fucking mime
I play practical jokes
This squirting flower
That wasn't flour
That blew up your nose
It's my special blend
Of X, coke, and K
You should be okay
In several hours

He's got over sized shoes, and ill-fitting clothes
That is real blood dripping from his fake red nose

I'm Cokie the Clown
I will trip you down
Those 12 giant steps
I brought you all presents
Against good judgment
But being a good host
You all have been dosed
The kettle corn's been laced
The fudge has been lined
You're having a great time
But you might not recall
From rohypnol
In the lemonade
Cokie homemade

He's the happiest clown
With the biggest frown
He's Cokie the Clown"

I hear voices over my shoulder
Nothing's making sense at all
Wonder, why do we race?
When everyday we're running in circles
Such a funny way to fall

Tried to open up my eyes
I'm hoping for a chance to make it alright

When I wake up the dream isn't done
I want to see your face and know I made it home
If nothing is true, what more can I do?
I am still painting flowers for you

Show my cards, gave you my heart
Wish we could start all over
Nothing's making sense at all

Tried to open up my eyes
I'm hoping for a chance to make it alright

When I wake up the dream isn't done
I want to see your face and know I made it home
If nothing is true, what more can I do?
I am still painting flowers for you
I am still painting flowers for you

I heard everything you said
I don't want to lose my head

When I wake up the dream isn't done
I want to see your face and know I made it home
If nothing is true, what more can I do?
I am still painting flowers for you
I am still painting flowers for you
I am still painting flowers for you"

And war is boring, it's not enough, I need a shock down to my shoes

As long as it's on a TV screen, keep it away from my house, man
I'm long gone
I'm long gone
I'm long gone
My senses are burned to the core
So fuck me hard, I still want more
Sedation now is what I need
So I don't have to live with me
Slavery is still alive
Somebody's praying
Take anything you want
Just don't show me who I am

Sedate me with anything so I don't have to live with me
And tell me, tell me that I'm free
Kill me with everything until there's nothing left of me
And tell me, tell me that I'm free
Give me some gasoline
Give me some gasoline
The beginning of this new time is coming to an end
We have run from all our ills, but we won't run again

Searching for a life, beginning a new dream

You had your love to give, so much life to live

It's not the end of the world, I've seen this film before
Already know the ending, some of the faces change
But the plot, it stays the same
Take my hand
Let's walk away
What did those big eyes see, a world where's nothing's free
Your innocent beauty slipping quietly
With every turn you found no one to understand
Why would you feel so down, no one to really see
What a woman you could be
Hey little girl, don't look so sad
It's not the end of the world, I've seen this film before
Already know the ending, some of the faces change
But the plot, it stays the same

Where the city meets the sea

Stripped away by the pain of broken dreams
All of these emotions

And put all my shit in boxes
It's 8 AM so I'm glad I wasn't out late
And I woke up today
Guess it's good I hadn't finished
Unpacking all of this in the first place


Suburbs have abandoned me
I've had the same best friend since '93
I call he's not answering (no)
I can't get comfortable on my own street
I'm not fond of South Philly
Or how my neighbors love ICP
I guess it's better than Bancroft Street
At least the fridge here works and the walls don't leak,
At least I'm starting to see
What's left for me
I'm starting to

We moved on again, so
I packed my shit and left home
It's alright to think I still belong to something I don't
'Cuz I could see why you'd think so

Nothing made me feel further away
Than Left and Leaving through a blown car stereo
Nothing made me feel closer to home
Than Ready to Die through my headphones
So we reached the coast
Where do we sleep tonight?
Damned if I know
We'll try to stay in the airport
Can't send us home and we got no place to go

'Cuz I could see why you'd think so
Don't say it's up to me
Don't say
Don't say
The creaks in the floorboards are calling out to me
I'm laying here again
With my head on my backpack
Wrapped in my hoodie
This is how it is when
Don't say it's up to me
Don't say

I stacked Lonelier than God
Next to You Get So Alone Sometimes
I know how this must look from the outside
It took almost thirteen months

The Wonder Years,I Was Scared and I'm Sorry,The Upsides,01/26/2010,"I've been obviously on the verge of a mental breakdown this week
Stuck between your dirty sheets and back-lit memories
And I've been putting off things like getting my shit out of your apartment
I've been making up excuses about the things that you might need
And I've been trying to find out where everyone's been
But they're nowhere and I'm nothing
And I've been trying to stay as busy as I can
I finally broke on Christmas Eve
In an Outback Steakhouse bathroom while my family ordered for me
Haven't been losing sleep, no I pass out almost instantly
The bad dreams get worse every week
I think I'm losing a little of me
:
I'm getting better, but it's in small steps
I'm working on sleeping on the left
I just can't blame New York for this
And so I'm down again, but this time it's different
I'm mourning something that I miss
And that's better than being hopeless
I'm counting back on all my mistakes
From the back of the cop car where you told me you loved me
Cause after that night, I got scared and I'm sorry
But hey, what can I say?
And I've been trying to find out where everyone's been
But they're nowhere
I'm still nothing
And I've been trying to find old friends

I'm getting better, but it's in small steps
I'm working on sleeping on the left
I just can't blame New York for this
And so I'm down again, but this time it's different
I'm mourning something that I miss
And that's better than being hopeless
It's getting weird to think
About the house on Manton Street
And how neither of us live there
It's probably empty
She watches Breakfast at Tiffany's, it calms her completely
I guess Sarah Marshall does the same for me
It's nothing when she's leaning on me and saying she's sorry
I'm obviously on the verge of a mental breakdown this week

I'm getting better, but it's in small steps

I felt something in me change
I was thinking about
How we all feel
But the worlds not such a shitty place
We just can't blame the seasons
The Blue Man Group won't cure depression
I can see we brought it on ourselves
With bad attitudes and
You should come by at eleven
You haven't seen the new apartment
We'll laugh about the shit we got into in high school
And I can't pretend

I'm afraid that we're wasting away
Cause we're all sleeping in circles
Or talking shit in diners
And I've been better, but I'm feeling okay
I'm not even sad anymore
I'm just so tired most nights

And I've been drowning my sorrows
In Lucky Charms and Soy Milk
These are the things that keep me sane
Getting pretzels at midnight behind my house
At the price you can't complain
We set off fireworks
Piss off the whole neighborhood
They keep me up having sex anyway
This stoop has seen much worse
We'll set off a few more
Maybe I'll blow off a piece of this city I hate

I'm afraid that we're wasting away
Cause we're all sleeping in circles
Or talking shit in diners
And I've been better, but I'm feeling okay
I'm not even sad anymore
I'm just so tired most nights

They turned on the fountain today
At Logan Circle
They turned on the fountain today
They turned on the fountain today
At Logan Circle
I felt something in me change
I'm afraid that we're wasting away

The Wonder Years,Melrose Diner,The Upsides,01/26/2010,"I hate your bad tattoos and your second-hand stories;
Those anecdotes that grew old last month
I hate the way you move when you're drunk and try dancing
It's not sexy
It's just keeping us up and I'm just not fond of anyone
And that's got everything to do with us
I hate the way I get when I can't handle bad news
It feels like I've been an asshole for months
All I've got left are these handfuls of fuck you and man
That's never enough
I guess I'm just down
I guess I'll be honest
I could use you around
I can't stand the dork that you're hanging with now
I guess I'll be honest
I could use you around
I hate the way that you can't keep your hair straight
I hate the way that you're leaning on me
I hate the way that you point out when girls are staring
Because you know that I won't do a thing
I hate the context clues you leave out of your writing
Because I can't find myself here at all
You know that I hate when you call me wasted
I expect it whenever you call
I guess I'm just down
I guess I'll be honest
I could use you around
I can't stand the dork that you're hanging with now
I guess I'll be honest
I could use you around
I could use you around
I could use you around now
My friends all say he's just a b-rate version of me;
He's stuck on video games and weed
They're just trying to help me get to sleep and
My friends all say you're sitting way too close to me
That I should just get up and leave
It's like I'm weighed down to the seat and
My friends all say he's just the broke-dick version of me
They're just trying to help me get some sleep
I know he's what you need
I guess I'm just down

If it would pick a shoulder to lean on
So I could stand up straight

I'm not sad anymore, I'm just tired of this place
The homophobic bullshit that's somehow okay
Just because you didn't mean it that way
I can't take anymore of all the scum in this place
Shitty dudes with tribal tattoos all around
Lining up cheap beer and roofies for a party at their place
Trying to convince freshmen they're somebody
By spending all of their parents' money on kegstands
And Matt says I don't fit in
All this mallrat goth shit is killing me
Thought that would end with high school at least
But there are still kids and Matt says
""College hit those dudes like a ton of bricks.""

So they're calling it blasphemy
A fucking catastrophe
For saying it's a stupid choice to make
But this place just brings misery
I hate what it does to me
I fight, but I can't escape the way that I don't fit in with any of this
And I don't think we're the same

I'm fucking losing my head trying to understand this
Kids outside with guitars hoping for someone to notice
No one wants to hear your sappy bullshit
All these fake-tan girls laughing at art school kids
Getting lots in return for being substanceless
You're too caught in semantics to see it
But you're no fucking different

So they're calling it blasphemy

I hate what it does to me
I fight, but I can't escape the way that I don't fit in with any of this

I'm not sad anymore, I'm just waiting
It's two more months 'til I'm done with this
And I don't make sense to anyone but my best friends
And I don't fit in anywhere but the back of the van
And I don't, I don't make sense to anyone but my best friends

But it was bound to happen
In case you were wondering
I'm twenty three and avoiding the bar scene
Lycra pants, and designer jeans
In case you were wondering
I'm staying in
I won't smell like cheap perfume or cigarettes tonight
And every word that I said got drowned out
By a dance remix of a pop song I don't care about
In case you forgot how bad I've been down
Just ask around cause you know this town loves to run its mouth

Say, say you'll stay in with me today
Say, say you'll stay
Cause you won't find me on the north Jersey club scene
With the Girls Gone Wild B-team
I don't need to pump my fist to look sweet
In case you were wondering
I promised myself that I would try to be more social at parties
Can someone tell these kids liking the rain no longer counts as an idiosyncrasy
In fact, I think that Rupert Holmes wrote a song about it in the '70s
And consequently, he also saved the Pina Colada industry

Say, say you'll stay in with me today

I don't need to pump my fist to look sweet
Say, say, say, say you'll stay

I can't believe I ended up here again
Watching this terrible band play songs I hate in the basement
I can't believe that I got stuck here again
While the kid with the dreads tells me he's smarter on acid
I can't believe that I'm not finding a way so just say

Shut your little trap
It's a pleasure cruise
When you're born to lose

Would you act like you know
And at the driving range
You shouted fire away
I started feeling strange
Thought of taking my life
And then I told you so
I fucking told you so"
Joyce Manor,Chumped,Constant Headache,03/20/2010,"Some salty stoned night
You cut up your hair bad again
And so you cough up a fake smile
And hate to be photographed skin
Now I'm feeling chumped on the bus
Left out of breath out of touch
Fixed gear, this frat boy who won't lend an ear
Why should he bother his father's career?
Feeling hopeful and helpless
Talking shit all the same
Do you keep having nightmares
About the old gang
Or when I keep reminding
Myself this will pass
But myself keeps reminding me
It will come back
Some salty stoned night
Some salty stoned night
Some salty stoned night
You cut up your hair bad again"

Flooding puddles in the storm drains
And if you follow the bay to the Pacific ocean
All the kids are playing and the moms are bathing
And the baby brothers all get swept away
Paint cans left out all night in the rain
You've been rusted shut, forever to be contained
You'll never play in the ocean or stain the cement
You've been promised something that you won't ever get
It's done right discount flooring

Oh shit, what do you know?
My conditional love is a fucking joke"
The Menzingers,Time Tables,Chamberlain Waits,04/13/2010,"Once she came like a vision in the night
I fell in love before the morning arrived
She wore a blue dress to combat the heat
Drank beer from a bottle and danced in the street
Then I heard her singing something fairly familiar
A tale of two lovers in the thick of the summer
There in the moment, we kissed in the hammock
We argued over which Bad Religion album was better
Well, I thought 'No Control' or 'Suffer'
And then she became queen of the neighborhood parties
'Cause I was an unknown boy along for the ride
Kept the guitar right by my side
It was better than conversing with the kids I didn't like
But on the fourth of July, when the fireworks rang out
She met a new boy who was more hip and less strung out
I drove home with fire in the sky
Fiddled with the dials and stumbled across something
That you were always humming
As time tables suggest
We were only just friends
In constant motions, covering stilts
I'll give you a dollar for another ride home
Or something to mix with your Coke
Well maybe if you want to wander around outside tonight
Meet me in Lake Ariel after midnight
Or really whenever, I only want to talk
I only want to relive what was lost
As time tables suggest
We were only just friends
In constant motions, covering stilts
I'll give you a dollar for another ride home
Or something to mix with...

Right and wrong blur to grey
You start the day with nothing good to say
Never thought you be this way
So scared of growing old
Friend hold on do you need a break?
(Slow down this manic pace
Smash a fucking plate
It'll make you feel much better)
From these shitty jobs and mold houses
Broken bones and overdoses
The fact that we survive at all is kind of a surprise

I disagreed then
Don't anymore
And what's the use?

Cuz I was never half as bad as you were bad to me
Being real not being mean

Making a scene, like it's her birthday
Drinking champagne, going insane
Falling on me, like it's her birthday
This ain't the night I thought it'd be
And she ain't shy, apparently
Cause she's in the crowd and everybody sings
Like it's her birthday

She turns and says don't be surprised, it's going to be a good night
A good, good night
She's showing me a different side, one I've never seen before
That I ignore
Cause when I'm up she's all about me
When I'm down she stays around me
Now I know I'm one and only
So I might as well enjoy the ride

Good Charlotte,1979,Cardiology,10/27/2010,"Life was simple
Roger was working around the clock to make a living
No computers, none of that; he used his two hands
Ignored the cold war, his wife would keep him warm
On the weekends
He'd load the car up with his kids and they'd go fishing
No need to work an extra job, there's no recession
Damn right, he smiled a lot, they'd lay awake at night so in love

It was a good good year
The kids were alright
""Highway to Hell"" beat up ""Staying Alive""
The Clash was on the radio
And mom and dad were still in love in 1979
It was a good good year

In the morning
Robin always woke up early in the kitchen
She'd make the coffee, pack his lunch and then she'd kiss him
And he would hold her tight, when they were newlyweds
He'd say maybe
And she would laugh, they knew they'd have another baby
She'd slave away all day until dinner was ready
And they would dance so slow to ""Just the Way You Are""


All the decades and the years have passed
Not every family is built to last
No time can take away these memories
Remember when you said to me, that we'd be alright


Disco couldn't survive
With the ""Dream Police"" and ""Rock & Roll High""
Blondie put out ""Heart of Glass""
And mom and dad bought their first house in 1979

Everyone's been calling like I've been gone for days
There's a note left on the table and all it says is ""Thanks""
It's starting to get focused and I'm finally awake
I'm feeling kind of guilty. Is there something I can take?
There's lipstick on my collar. I'm piecing it together
Then I see a picture of me and you

Last night (last night)
Can't remember (remember)
What happened? (What happened?)
Where'd we go?
I woke up (woke up)
This morning. (This morning)
Where's my car? Where's my keys? Where's my clothes?
I feel my head's still spinning
But I'm doing alright (hey)
'Cause I think I just had the best night of my life
Last night (last night)
Can't remember (remember)
What happened? Did it happen? Last night

And did I get the chance to say that I wanted you to stay?
There's things I can't explain, 'cause my brain don't work that way
Don't call this a one night stand. No, it wasn't planned
Wasn't in my head but I just want to do it again and again and again just like

Last night (last night)
Can't remember (remember)
What happened? (What happened?)
Where'd we go?
I woke up (woke up)

A Day to Remember,2nd Sucks,What Separates Me From You,11/11/2010,"FIGHT!

You're afraid, like I make my deals with the devil
You've been at it for years, but couldn't reach that next level
Let's keep it real, this is no competition to me
Even if everyone around you acts like they don't see

(Oh!) Is anybody else listening? Outta sight outta mind is what you'll always be
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest. I laid my life on the line so I expect nothing less from you

I speak the truth and everybody else knows it
So set your ego to the side and just get the fuck over it
Can't waste my time on hateful people like you
So keep wishing you were me and I'll keep making you have to

(Oh!) Is anybody else listening? Outta sight outta mind is what you'll always be
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest. I laid my life on the line so I expect nothing less from you

I just can't believe it's really come to this
Because without me, you would not exist

(Hey, hey!)
Still got something left to say
Only one in the world that I depend on is me
I need nothing from no one, I take what I need
Get a hold of yourself, and keep away from me

(Oh!) Is anybody else listening? Outta sight outta mind is what you'll always be
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest. I laid my life on the line so I expect nothing less from you"
A Day to Remember,All I Want,What Separates Me From You,11/15/2010,"I'm always screaming my lungs out 'til my head starts spinning
Playing my songs is the way I cope with life
Won't keep my voice down
Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud
I like to keep things honest
I'm a safe bet like your life's staked on it, for real
I'd hate to keep you all wondering
I'm constant like the seasons
And I will never be forgotten man

Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
Keep your hopes up high and your head down low

Still got something left to prove
It tends to keep things movin' while everyone around me says
My last days are looming overhead
But just what the hell do they think they know?
I keep my head above the water, while they drown in the undertow

Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low

If you take it from me, live your life for yourself
Cause when it's all said and done, you don't need anyone else
C'mon!

So let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
Not a worry in the world, tell me was this all worth it?
I get what I want so everyone's always judging me
I'm not afraid of anything, I've got the whole world in front of me

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low

Keep your heads down low, keep your heads down low
Keep your hopes up high, and your heads down low"
A Day to Remember,All Signs Point to Lauderdale,What Separates Me From You,11/15/2010,"I hate this town, it's so washed up, And all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck When will I find where I fit in?
2, 3, 4

Remember when I tried, I never strayed too far from you
Forever by your side, No matter what I was going through
But now I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me, guess, I was always wrong

I hate this town, it's so washed up, and all my friends don't give a fuck

I hate this town

My world cannot ever bring me down
Gave everything I had to turn it back around
Cause our time's worth something, Bigger than both you and me
I can't live my life always backing down
I gotta do this right, then they can't make a sound
Cause I'm not here for nothing, Least I can say I stand for something
(You and me, we stand for something)

I hate this town, it's so washed up, and all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck, When will I find where I fit in?

A Day to Remember,Better Off This Way,What Separates Me From You,11/15/2010,"I wonder if you'll notice, If they lock me up and throw away the key
Try to be open minded, you've got a lot to learn in the ways of me
You always got to say something
I'm none of your concern but you won't listen at all
You know I'd rather say nothing
And just be proud of myself for tearing down these walls

When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay
It's all over, I found a better way to help keep you from me

I'm better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh

You gotta keep this coming
Tell it like you know it but you don't know nothing
Your call, we can settle this like gentlemen
Or meet me out the back to end it all and start again
My whole life's spent waiting
Ever since I can remember been anticipating your fall
And God let it be a long one
Can't let go of my grudge till I know you're done

When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay
It's all over, I found a better way to help keep you from me
I'm better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh
I'm better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh

You want it, you've got it
You've always been such a waste of time
You want it, you've got it
A friend of yours is no friend of mine
You want it, you've got it
When will you act your age
You want it, you've got it
You're the reason things have to change

Woah-oh, woah-oh
You're the reason things have to change
Woah-oh, woah-oh

When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay

I'll keep to myself, avoid the sun
Cancel plans with everyone
I know cause it's just how it always ends
Our bond will break cause you can't relate
To anyone, to anything at all

You brought your worst and I'm right here
No I've seen it all, and it's never been so clear

You're not the person that I knew back then
It's all too late to set things right cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then

Never want to be, caught in between
I need constant reminders of everything
(So what!) It's who I am, I played it off so well
I just hold it in, no matter how I've been
So nobody, nobody can tell

You brought your worst and I'm right here

Can't let our problems find me here so everybody come on!

A Day to Remember,Out of Time,What Separates Me From You,11/15/2010,"I've never felt so sober
I've never felt the low that I feel tonight
Your words made everything drag on and on
I finally found her
And when I did I just couldn't make things right
Is this really happening? Oh, God, I think I just ruined my life

What the fuck am I doing?
I can't tell the difference from wrong and right
I second-guess my decisions
'Cause I haven't been this person in my whole life
I think I need something new here
When I keep longing for what I had
No need for second opinions
I do the best I can to ruin what I have, come on

Don't think you've got to go in alone here
I've got nothing left to hide
You're dying, just make up your mind

I thought this was what you wanted
Someone who gets everything right
Gets everything right
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone to put you first in their life
Cause we're running out of time

Let's have three cheers for the new year (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Here's a moment that's not as bad
This wasn't part of my vision
The optimistic me says we can make this last, but no
You ruined my favorite records
Listen to them and I think of you
I just hope you remember
All of the countless times that I believed in you, for what?

Don't think you've got to go in alone here
I've got nothing left to hide
You're dying, just make up your mind

I thought this was what you wanted
Someone who gets everything right
Gets everything right
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone to put you first in their life

Just know that it kills me
When I hear anything to do with you
You won't see it, but believe me
I need to be right where you are
You know that I'm leaving
And you won't hear 'till a year from now
And this kills me
'Cause now I think that everything's, everything's about you

I thought this was what you wanted
Someone who gets everything right
Gets everything right
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone to put you first in their life
Cause we're running out of time

A Day to Remember,Sticks & Bricks,What Separates Me From You,11/15/2010,"I am fueled by all forms of failure
I paid the price, so I'll take what's mine
Oh I bet ya didn't see that one coming
Cause I do as I please, and apologize for nothing
My time is flying, but I'm still second to none
Always shining the brightest when I'm placed under the gun (God damn)
So here I stand
The only son of a working-class man
I won't be held back
I can't be held down
Where were you when my walls came falling down? (They came falling down)
You tried to hide, you stood close by, and didn't make a sound
Say something
Find you some paper, and I'll go grab you a pen
You can start taking notes on how this all started again
Been dead last, but found my way to the front
With my inspirational quotes on why I never gave up
Where were you when my walls came falling down? (They came falling down)
You tried to hide, you stood close by, and didn't make a sound
Where were you when it all came back around? (It goes back around)
The reasons why you passed me by will always hold you down
Say something
If you can't stand the pressure
Stay the fuck out of my way
I know my place
This one goes out to everyone who's lied to my face
My heart is filled with hate
I'm making a difference
I'm taking a chance (A chance)
You can say what you want about me
But no one can tell me I can't
Where were you when my walls came falling down? (They came falling down)
You tried to hide, you stood close by, and didn't make a sound
Where were you when it all came back around? (It goes back around)
The reasons why you passed me by will always hold you down
Say something"
A Day to Remember,This Is the House That Doubt Built,What Separates Me From You,11/15/2010,"Don't get me started on what it means to be alive
You're lying to yourself but then still you act surprised
Cause you're scared, can't come to terms with what you are
The wolves in sheep's clothing will only lead you so far

You'll wait and they'll go, cause in the end we all end up alone
So just wait you'll know

Forget everything just for tonight, we'll sing like everyone when they're alone
Cause I've been waiting for the night to say(Whoa, whoa)

I rely on myself, just making sure that was clear
I'm not in need of your crutches I faced all my fears
And I won, well
I knew I could have, life is not a punch card, make the best of what you have

Don't wait, just go, and when you find yourself please let me know
It's not too late, just let go

Forget everything just for tonight
We'll sing like everyone when they're alone
Cause I've been waiting for the night to say (Whoa, whoa)
Let's believe that if we all stand together
We're a force that can shake the whole world
For once we're doing something right when we say, (Whoa, whoa)

In the end it's not about what you have
In the end, it's all about where you want to go
And the roads you take to help you get there
I hope you think that's fair
Cause you've only got one life to lead
So don't take for granted those little things
Those little things are all that we have

Forget everything just for tonight
We'll sing like everyone when they're alone
Cause I've been waiting for the night to say (Whoa, whoa)
Let's believe that if we all stand together
We're a force that can shake the whole world
For once we're doing something right when we say, (Whoa, whoa)

A Day to Remember,"You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic",What Separates Me From You,11/15/2010,"I'm a mess, That's the best way to describe it
Having no time to myself is the only way I can fight it
When I'm alone it's like I'm staring into a mirror
Don't know the person inside it and that's never been any clearer
I miss your family and I miss all our friends
If you had it to do over would you do it over again
Cause I would, this meant something more to me
There's a hole in my heart where you used to be

I still wish you the best of luck, baby
And don't go thinking this was a waste of time
I couldn't forget you if I tried

You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I'll live with regret for my whole life

I confess that I brought this all on myself
Condemned to suffer alone, like there's nobody else
When you're gone, it's like a whole part of me's missing
So I'll keep living the lie and just hope that you're listening
I tried to make us a life here
But our foundation was built on sand
No time to run until the damage was done
And I've never had the upper hand

I still wish you the best of luck, baby
And don't go thinking this was a waste of time
I couldn't forget you if I tried

You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I'll live with regret for my whole life

All the things you love are all the things I hate
How did we get here in the first place?

I play it cool but it's hard to be (All my trust)
Is slowly burning inside of me (Over what)
There can't be anymore progress, I know our fate
The only thing that can heal this is time and space

You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I'll live with regret for my whole life
For my whole life"
RVIVR,Derailer,The Joester Sessions Collection,01/01/2011,"The west side the bad part of town
It's a cheap place to live so the white punks move in
Projects are one block away
People's eyes sometimes they seem to say
Get out get out you don't belong here
Get out get out it's your fault that the condos are just one block away
The thing is they're right I don't know what to say
We all need a space to be even if it's only temporary
Cause we don't think yeah we don't think bout anyone but ourselves
Josh was eleven years old when he came to the shop
He didn't really wanna learn his moods would change just like night and day
Learned to fix a flat and I liked him anyway
Get out get out
Get out get out
You gotta shout when no one is listening
We kicked him out and I never saw him again
We all need a space to be even if it's only temporary
Cause we don't think yeah we don't think bout anyone but ourselves
Always talking bout community but like to forget about the family down the street
Cause we don't think yeah we don't think bout anyone but ourselves
The city tries to take it away
Yeah the city tries to take it away
But the people still sing
Yeah the people still sing
The people keep singing"
Joyce Manor,21st Dead Rats,Joyce Manor,01/11/2011,"You're the worst in turn, the first of the night
Who could stand there staring at the blacks of your eyes?
What a curious type, reaching out for the iron
To never ask for a slap, but don't indulge in a smile
We're twenty-first dead rats again

You're the worst in turn, the first of the hour
I can feel it creeping on me out of the shower
Like a film on a postcard, a moment entranced
And with the confidence of prom queens, insist on me asking
Well say it was me, who's getting sick on my jeans
Just as I thought about the part that goes, ""You're such a disease.""
Go on and call around after I've been put down
So fucking empty when it hits, you'll hear a hollow sound
I'm twenty-first dead rats again"
Joyce Manor,Ashtray Petting Zoo,Joyce Manor,01/11/2011,"I walked in to find what's worse than worst of all time
I walked out to see exactly what I expected to see
You were there
Horrible fingers ran right through your hair
Scabs on everything
Stark white flesh

Gaining momentum and hitting its stride
Nothing to run from and nowhere to hide
Oh, God bless you, ashtray petting zoo

I am sin to write the love song of your life
I came out to see, the sweet song took a shine to me
I walked out to regret it
He will rot there if you let him
I had money riding on your decomposure
Money won't buy me a sense of closure

Gaining momentum and hitting its stride
Nothing but reasons to go for a ride
Oh, God bless you, ashtray petting zoo"
Joyce Manor,Beach Community,Joyce Manor,01/11/2011,"I lost it all in a beach community
Where it was lost is not all that clear to me
Over the sidewalk, into a slow talk
Call the police
Told me I'm in the wrong town

Wait for your cue cause my scene it ain't over
I torch up your house while your kids are at home
What can you do when you're not getting sober?
It's hard to admit but you're always feeling alone
You're always feeling alone

Just a few miles down as the streets count backwards
I realize it's true
Everything reminds me of you"
Joyce Manor,Call Out (Laundry),Joyce Manor,01/11/2011,"I would say I'm sorry but I'm not sorry

Entertain my lack of interest
'Cause the one you are ain't the one that I'm after
Closing in on your heart with the worst of intentions
(I call out)

I could send you all away
I can see you from the foot of my bed
I can't make out a face
Don't ever ask me how I spend the only part of my life I like
All locked away inside a bedroom
On the handlebars of your bike
I rode a wave of emotion I can't begin to place
And as we sat by the ocean, it crawled across your face
I call out"
Joyce Manor,Constant Headache,Joyce Manor,01/11/2011,"I could hear you coming, so I hid by the couch
You were talking so loudly, I don't know what about
But you were drunker than high school, self-conscious and sweet
I never ever felt so cool disguised in your sheets

But I'm a constant headache, a tooth out of line
They try to make you regret it
You tell 'em, ""No, not this time.""
I'm just a constant headache, a dead pet device
You hang me up unfinished
With the better part of me no longer mine

And then you finally found me, pretending to sleep
You said such nice things about me, I felt guilty and cheap
You took two steps to the kitchen and just stared at the sink
I couldn't hold back a smile, I still wish I could have seen
You having sex in the morning, your love was foreign to me
It made me think maybe human's not such a bad thing to be
But I just laid there in protest, entirely fucked
It's such a stubborn reminder one perfect night's not enough

It's just a constant headache, a tooth out of line
They try to make you regret it
You tell 'em, ""No, not this time.""
It's just a constant headache, a dead pet device
You hang me up unfinished
With the better part of me no longer mine"
Joyce Manor,Constant Nothing,Joyce Manor,01/11/2011,"Hey wait, cough count keep me awake
Low key, happy and harmless it's so un-alarming
I can feel it coming out of your AC vents

And it just wears me out
Oh, it just wears me out

You'll get nothing and like it
You'll learn to be quiet
It's a wonderful way to behave in the company of someone you can't tolerate
Oh, I'm just
Hold on
I said it like thirty times in a row

And it just wears me out
Oh, it just wears me out"
Joyce Manor,Derailed,Joyce Manor,01/11/2011,"When you make it to your driveway
Will you call to let me know that you're okay?
And when you make it to your bedroom
Do you collapse on your bed right away?
Or do you lay and think about how fucking lonely you've become?
You're obsessed with revenge and it's starting again
Bad tattoos, oh, and losing the saddest of friends, so you

Ache through the days
'Cause you'll never mend your ways

And when you make a decent living
Will you buy me a train set and a hat?
So that I can sit alone in my room
Sending people away from the ones they love
Or crash them into buildings
Explosions, derailments and screaming children
Oh my god, I think I'm in love
Yes, I know that this must be love, when you

Ache through the days

Joyce Manor,Famous Friend,Joyce Manor,01/11/2011,"Famous friend, why are you telling lies again?

But I'm laughing 'til I'm crying in the end

Separate you from the notion that you're something I could never try to be myself
Only for somebody else
In your car I couldn't tell how to tell
So try to be cool

Hated friend, why are you coming round again?
Pissing out your insecurities to people who don't need you now
They've found someone who can have a little fun
It makes you wonder how you ever felt affection for somebody who could hate you so
Oh, I'd really like to know what it takes to say, ""I am strong."""

I miss the way we talked before you went away to school
Now all you seem to say is ""Baby, how could it be you?""
I hate the way you're leaning and you're looking at your phone
I hate the way I feel like dying when I'm alone

Can you picture my reaction to the word up on the wall?
Is there really something wrong with me?

Stretching out cheap cotton over your thick skull
I'm down here under the pavement so inept
Until I grab that pen beside you
Jam it into your eye
See, now you're my kind of man
Now you're a stand-up kind of guy

I am dying of embarrassment
I'm dying of this hatred
I can't rest until you know this bitterness that I have tasted
Such humiliation for the first and only time
I'm obsessed with your self-righteousness
Cut in half by your smile

Into the night
You're getting harder to believe in
You're a cold and quiet paradise
Transfixed just by your breathing
Into the night
And you're the one thing I don't hate
You're a cold and quiet paradise
My only true escape into the night"

I'm half the world away
I'm letting you go now
(Go now)

You've got sadness twisted up with jealousy
You show your fists to make them look like loyalty
And I have seen what holding on can take away
If it's the past you love, then that's where you can stay

Can you hear the crowd?
They all go wild
For you and your denial
They're watching you break down
(Break down)
Hate me all you want; I'll be okay
I'm half the world away
I'm letting you go now
(Go now)

Desperation kills
When it's on your sleeve, you wear it well
Underneath it all
You'll always have this war inside yourself
I'm letting you go now

It was the first thing that I did
What every townie kid dreams of
I packed and started west
A thousand dollars I had saved
And my sister's two cassettes
The Dead from Fillmore East
And Otis Redding's Greatest Hits

Coffee and cigarettes
As simple as it gets
Of all the things I think I'll miss
There's staying up with you
Coffee and cigarettes
Coffee and cigarettes

Then, I commit with some restraint
To a boy I thought might care
It didn't work but I found out soon
And never dug roots there
I've been a lot of places since
And nothing else compares
To easy times and easy eyes
To meet you in a stare

Coffee and cigarettes
As simple as it gets
Of all the things I think I'll miss
There's staying up with you
Coffee and cigarettes

Changing keys
Giving up on me to find familiar things
And try blending in
Know this, please

And all my life, I looked for you
For arms that I could fall into

All I can think about is
You and me driving with a Saves the Day record on
We were singing 'til our voices were gone
And I was falling hard
You were barely hanging on
And now, I wanna chase forever down

Having nightmares, dreaming that I'm gonna leave

It's not the same without you kids

Spent the rest of the night in the ER

Through coffee eyes and blank stares
Our late night affairs
There's always been a table for me there
So you can try to forget or say it's the past
You know you'll always end up right back where you left
I ended up here late at night on Thanksgiving
The fall that Colleen left
This was the place to call home
When it felt like the world didn't want us
I watched Mike slash Mon's tires
We laughed about it later
I watched friendships dissolve
In the booth on the back wall

So we'll take it over ice tonight
With a little salt
And a little lime

You're just a daydream away
I wouldn't know what to say if I had you
And I'll keep you a daydream away
Just watch from a safe place
So I never have to lose

You're just a daydream away
I wouldn't know what to say if I had you"
Paramore,Monster,Singles Club,06/07/2011,"You were my conscience
So solid, now you're like water
And we started drowning
Not like we'd sink any farther
But I let my heart go
It's somewhere down at the bottom
But I'll get a new one
And come back for the hope that you've stolen

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder, how we survive?
Well, now that you're gone, the world is ours

I'm only human
I've got a skeleton in me
But I'm not the villain
Despite what you're always preaching
They call me a traitor
I'm just collecting your victims
They're getting stronger
And I hear them calling
Calling (calling)

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder, how we survive?
Well, now that you're gone, the world is ours

Well you find your strength in solution
But I like the tension
And not always knowing the answers
But you're gonna lose it
You're gonna lose it

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder, how we survive?
Now that you're gone, the world...
I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster and eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder, how we survive?
Now that you're gone, the world is ours"

Louis Vuitton suitcases
Look at all their pretty faces

So why do I feel like it's all just a show?

Because of you, my life has a purpose
You helped me be who I am today
I see myself in every word you say
Sometimes it feels like nobody gets me
Trapped in a world where everyone hates me
There's so much that I'm going through
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you

I was broken, I was choking, I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding, stopped believing, could have died
This song saved my life
I was down, I was drowning, but it came on just in time
This song saved my life

Sometimes I feel like you've known me forever
You always know how to make me feel better
Because of you my dad and me
Are so much closer than we used to be
You're my escape when I'm stuck in a small town
I turn you up whenever I feel down
You let me know like no one else
That it's okay to be myself

I was broken, I was choking, I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding, stopped believing, could have died
This song saved my life
I was down, I was drowning, but it came on just in time
This song saved my life

You'll never know what it means to me
That I'm not alone, that I'll never have to be

I was broken, I was choking, I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding, stopped believing, could have died
This song saved my life
I was down, I was drowning, but it came on just in time

Of getting past skin deep

I got burned, but you're the real loser
I don't know why I've wasted my time with you, whoa

You can't trust a serial cheater
You're good at hooking up, but you suck at love
You suck at love

You played me like an amateur
Then stabbed me like a murderer
I'm left for dead, another one of your victims
It's not like you're unpredictable
But your act is so believable
I know it's nothing personal, it's just business as usual
You're good at what you do

The Wonder Years,And Now I'm Nothing,Suburbia I've Given You All and Now I'm Nothing,06/14/2011,"I can't help myself
I keep ending up in Memorial Park
Breaking finger nails while I claw at the frozen ground
Because as long as I'm home
I can dig up these bones
There's no point to just letting go
And as long as you've known me I've been backing out slowly
I won't end up underneath the snow, the snow
This is where it's been
The manger scene every Christmas
Next to the cannon
Every year someone steals baby Jesus
Nobody stops them
It's a nice tradition
I'll put my life back together in silence
While writing songs on Molly's guitar
And Suburbia, stop pushing
I know what I'm doing
So I moved myself and two boxes of things
To the basement room at Richie's house
And I'm happy here for now
Because I've been in search of some steadier footing
Or just a place to call home
I know that I'm introspective when broken
But I've been spending most of my nights here alone
And that doesn't scare me like it did a year ago
I'll put my life back together in silence
While writing songs on Molly's guitar
And Suburbia, stop pushing
I know what I'm doing
Suburbia, stop pushing
I know what I'm doing
Suburbia, stop pushing
I know what I'm doing
I had dreams of myself
As the Allen Ginsberg of this generation
But without the talent, madness or vision
I guess it's looking hopeless
We're a city left digging out cars in unison
And humming like we've healed
I know we've got miles to go
But I'm putting my shoulder to the wheel"

And out of our old apartment
I know things changed but I'm not sure when
I guess you'd call this regression
I left a real job and a girlfriend
I convinced myself that I'm brave enough for all of this
Well, I spent this whole year in airports
And the floor feels like home
Oh, at least we're never alone
I lost track of the time zones and I'd call but you know

I'm running on empty
The late nights and the long drives start to get to me
I'm just so tired

I spent this year as a ghost and I'm not sure what I'm looking for
I'm a voice on a phone that you rarely answer anymore
I came in here alone
Came in here alone
(But that doesn't scare me like it did seven months ago)
I spent this year as a ghost and I'm not sure where home is anymore

Been on a steady fast food diet
Like we're this generation's Morgan Spurlock
But we don't admit defeat
My body feels rejected and I can't say that I blame it
My heart keeps saying stay young
My lower back seems to disagree
I unrolled a cheap cotton blanket on an old dirty couch
I felt the year start to wind down
I can't stand any dead space
Empty beds bum me out

I spent this year as a ghost and I'm not sure what I'm looking for
I'm a voice on a phone that you rarely answer anymore
I came in here alone
Came in here alone
(But that doesn't scare me like it did seven months ago)
I spent this year as a ghost and I'm not sure where home is anymore

I came out swinging from a South Philly basement
Caked in stale beer and sweat under half-lit fluorescents
And I spent the winter writing songs about getting better
And if I'm being honest, I'm getting there
I came out swinging from a South Philly basement
Caked in stale beer and sweat under half-lit fluorescents
And I spent the winter writing songs about getting better
And if I'm being honest, I'm getting there

And I've been frequenting a diner on Main Street
Where the waitresses are girls that graduated with me
Have problems with oxy, and can't recall what I had to drink
No one knows where they're going
They just know they want out of here badly
Like cigarettes dropped on a highway
They smash, and scatter, and burn out
Somewhere else without knowing

I've got my grandmother's veins in the back of my hands
And just a hint of a South Philly accent
I was born here
(I'll probably die here)
Let's go home

This town's got lies to tell
I'll wait around to hear you out
But I can't keep from digging up these bones forever
At least for now, I'll settle down
I'll try to find some solid ground
I lost my footing trying to get home last winter

The kids in the graduating class
Have got their eyes set west
And California on their lips
But I left some blood there, that I'm never getting back
Rocky's in the Deep South, I don't think he's coming back now
It's sinister, but it's how life worked out

I've got my grandmother's veins in the back of my hands
And just a hint of a South Philly accent
I was born here

I'll wait around to hear you out
But I can't keep from digging up these bones forever
At least for now, I'll settle down
I'll try to find some solid ground
I lost my footing trying to get home last winter

Growing up means
Watching my heroes turn human in front of me
And the songs we wrote at eighteen
Seem shortsighted and naive
So when the weather breaks
I'll pull my hoodie up over my face
I won't run away, run away
'Cause as fucked as this place got, it made me me

This town's got lies to tell
I'll wait around to hear you out
But I can't keep from digging up these bones forever
At least for now, I'll settle down
I'll try to find some solid ground
I lost my footing trying to get home last winter
This town's got lies to tell"

My living room with best friends
So raise your glasses

We don't have trouble sleeping
No one, no one's gonna take that away from me
We don't have trouble sleeping
We know, we know who we wanna be

Fuck some movie that I swore Keanu Reeves was in
These doomsday prophesies are all gonna amount to nothing
And so, for now, I'm calling bullshit
If the Mayans don't believe it, why should I be any different?

But if the world ends, I hope I'm in
My living room with good friends
So raise your glasses

We don't have trouble sleeping
No one, no one's gonna take that away from me
We don't have trouble sleeping
We know, we know who we wanna be

This week is gonna swallow me
But when it spits me out, I'm landing on my feet
I'm going to bed tonight in my New Found Glory hoodie

So we can't be up late
You don't mind if I sleep in
But then I've gotta pack my things
So I stacked a Bukowski novel on a Blacklisted LP
And this time what it looked like was just what it proved to be
You said you needed a stiff drink to take your mind off things
Hey Jess, I woke up older
Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess, I watched you wake up and get dressed
You left the room receded like my hairline
I've been avoiding Rittenhouse like the plague
Because I just can't handle seeing you today
You made this house into a home
Now, I'm a stranger on my street
And as I turned to leave
I caught myself in the mirror to see I aged a year this week
I left a note up on your bed that said
""Hey, thanks again for everything you did""
Hey Jess, I woke up older
Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess, I watched you wake up and get dressed
You left the room receded like my hairline
When John introduced ""Woke Up New"" in St. Augustine
I knew I wasn't alone
When I woke up here without you
There was nothing to do but pack up and go home
Hey Jess, I woke up older
Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess, I woke up older
Carrying two years in the bags under my eyes
Hey Jess, I watched you wake up and get dressed

Like the last three years had never happened
It was how George walked down and threw dirt onto the casket
It was how I know you would want this to be a fast one
And not some cliche ballad
I'm slowing down in the August air
A heavy heart and shaking hands carried you up here
I buried half of a decade there
It was the better part
You'd catch the reference if only you could hear
Because I still hear you in the bass drum beat after ""I'll Catch You""
I'm left wondering if you meant anything when you typed out
""You never got me down, Ray. I never went down""
You know the fucked up part is
I kind of always knew we'd have to write a song about this
You know the fucked up part is
I had my fingers crossed that it wouldn't be for you, kid
You know the fucked up part is
It's been months, and I still have nightmares
You know the fucked up part is
I'm never going back there
You know the fucked up part is
The fucked up part is
The fucked up part is
The fucked up part is
Fuck

Blink-182,After Midnight,Neighborhoods (Deluxe),09/06/2011,"I can't get my feet up off the edge
I kinda like the little rush you get
When you're standing close to death
Like when you're driving me crazy
Hold on as we crash into the earth
A bit of pain will help you suffer when you're hurt, for real
Cause you were driving me crazy

Bite your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know? I'm here to stay

We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I hear are the many echoes of
The darkest words you said
And it's driving me crazy
I can't find the best in all of this
But I'm always looking out for you
Cause you're the one I miss
And it's driving me crazy

Bite your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know? I'm here to stay

Saves the Day,Daybreak,Daybreak,09/13/2011,"My heart is gone, it drove to the shore
Swam out in the night, way out past the lines
I heard that now it lives in the South
Of West Central Spain, drinking off the pain
Cause inside I'm broke, I'm cracked, I'm alone
No hope for a change, no way to erase
The world would be better without me
So how could this be, somehow you love me?

Stepped out to see the stars fall alone on the neighbor's lawn
I held my hand up, my head down, waiting to hear your call
I thought I saw your headlights in the dark driving by our house
I'm going out my mind
I'm giving up the fight this time
Love me or let go
No longer care if I die alone
Whole world is waiting, watching to see when you're gonna fall
10,000 faces staring, your back is against the wall
Fucked up past the point of fixing, so tell me what went wrong
I'm going out my mind
I'm giving up the fight this time
Love me or let go
No longer care if I die alone
Cause in the darkness of my mind I used to dream of suicide
I'm gonna pull myself out before I die
I'm going out my mind
I'm giving up the fight this time
Love me or let go
No longer care if I die alone

Now it's 8 in the morning
Up all night just walking around
I'm hiding out here under the window
By the sink where we used to laugh all day long
I wait 'til I see you walking
From the bedroom down to the kitchen
Fingering your hair into curls while talking
On the phone resting on your collarbone
Here I come again, head is hanging low
You put down the phone, take me in your arms
And I'm all alone with you, my love
Did you hear me coming?
Running over the words I said last night
While wishing I never saw your eyes swell up
With tears dripping down your thighs
I can't let it go, I'm lost inside
I can get so low, seems like there's no up
And I'm all alone so take me in your arms
Knowing I'm the one

I turn around to say, ""How could you still love me?""
Sun is shining, lighting up your face
You stare off into space, not knowing what to say
Searching for the words to set things straight
So I say, ""I'm a zig zag, sideways upside down, out of my mind
What's the point of living if we're all just born to die?""
You say, ""Why, why ask why?""
I say, ""I get fucked up.""
You say, ""Delusional.""
Somehow will you still open your arms?
""Come with me."" you say, we step outside to face the sun
Yesterday I dreamed that it would all burn down to dust

Take a breath, turn around
See the sun come through the clouds
The light alive in your eyes
Standing here by your side
Arm in arm under the sky
I know I want to hold on
The letters left on the lawn
The shadows crawling the wall
The mirror shatters and falls
I've been lost for so long
No more will to carry on
So dark and dead and diseased
Nothing left in the end
And to pray is to pretend
I'm tired of trying to believe
So can we learn to forgive?
I want to hold you again
Can we remember our love?
I can get so low, seems like there's no up
And I'm all alone so take me in your arms
Knowing I'm the one"
Simple Plan,Astronaut,Get Your Heart On!,09/19/2011,"Can anybody hear me?
Or am I talking to myself?
My mind is running empty
In this search for someone else
Who doesn't look right through me
It's all just static in my head
Can anybody tell me why
I'm lonely like a satellite?

'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
And I lost all signal when I lifted off
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
Can I please come down? (Come down)
Because I'm tired of driftin' around and 'round (And 'round)
Can I please come down?

I'm deafened by the silence
Is it somethin' that I've done?
I know that there are millions
I can't be the only one
So disconnected
It's so different in my head
Can anybody tell me why
I'm lonely like a satellite?

'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
And I lost all signal when I lifted off
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
Can I please come down?
Because I'm tired of driftin' around and 'round
Can I please come down?

Now I lie awake and scream, in the zero gravity
And it's starting to weigh down on me, whoa
Let's abort this mission now
Can I please come down?

So tonight I'm calling all astronauts
All the lonely people that the world forgot
If you hear my voice, come pick me up
Are you out there? 'Cause you're all I've got

And tonight, I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
And I lost all signal when I lifted off
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot

'Cause tonight, I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
To the lonely people that the world forgot
Are you out there? 'Cause you're all I've got
Can I please come down?
(Please, please, please come down)
Because I'm tired of driftin' around and 'round
(I'm tired of driftin' around)
Can I please come down?
(Please, please, please come down)
Can I please come down?
Can I please come down?"
The Ataris,All Souls Day,Hang Your Head in Hope (The Acoustic Sessions),11/24/2011,"You said you wanted to be loved
I think you wanted to be saved
Well, tell me, how am I supposed to save a girl like you
When I don't even know how to save myself?
Wish I could just forget
The double lives, the awkwardness
A union scarred by bitterness
A house we built on top of our regrets
There we were in California
Two tarnished golden hearts
Were we ever really together
Or just afraid of being apart?
I wish I could drive all night
Wake up in the harsh day light
In a different town, start a brand new life
And never have to see your face again
I wonder if the spell we're under
Will ever be broken
I wonder if the spell we're under
Is ever, ever going to end
I guess there's never any closure
Since the last look in our eyes
You said you hope that I'm happy now
And we both know, like everything, that's one big fucking lie
Wish I could turn around
Erase our lives, take back those vows
I guess it's not that easy now
I'll tear that fucking chapel to the ground
I wonder if the spell we're under
Will ever be broken
I wonder if the spell we're under
Is ever going to end
Today I woke up and these leaves had all withered
Faded and fell to the ground
Like our tired hearts
I wonder if the spell we're under
Will ever be broken
I wonder if the spell we're under
Will ever..
I wonder if the spell we're under
Will ever be broken
I wonder if the spell we're under
Is ever going to end
I wonder if the spell we're under
Will ever be broken
I wonder if the spell we're under
Is ever, ever going to end.."

These fumbled hands and nervous smiles
We medicate and stumble
To find the courage to talk aloud
In the streetlight silhouette
The neon halos shines so bright
While the radio cried young hearts be free tonight
So tell me how'd we end up here
We all want to feel something
Even if it's only for a moment
Tell me what happened to our dreams
We had when we were young
We're never looking back
Tonight, these echoes of our lives
Are calling out don't surrender, don't surrender
Tonight, these jukebox 45's
Are calling out don't surrender, don't surrender
Well I am just a bit part in this movie of your life
While the night brigade rolled on
Out on highway 95
We're carving out our lives
On these counterfeit guitars
While the ghost of our past ring down the boulevard
So tell me how'd we end up here
We all want to feel something
Even if it's only for a moment
Tell me what happened to our dreams
We had when we were young
We're never looking back
Tonight, these echoes of our lives
Are calling out don't surrender, don't surrender
Tonight, sad songs and whiskey nights
We're calling out don't surrender, don't surrender
We grew up chasing sunsets
Now we both just shut our eyes
We're never looking back now
We were young and oh so bold
And torn apart by county lines
We're never looking back
Tonight, these echoes of our lives
Are calling out don't surrender, don't surrender
Tonight, from the basements and the dives
We're calling out don't surrender, don't surrender"
All Time Low,Time-Bomb,Dirty Work (Deluxe Edition),11/30/2011,"From the get-go, I knew this was hard to hold
Like a crash, the whole thing spun out of control
Oh, on a wire, we were dancing
Two kids, no consequences
Pull the trigger without thinking
There's only one way down this road

It was like a time bomb set into motion
We knew that we were destined to explode
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you go
We're like a time bomb
Gonna lose it
Let's defuse it
Baby, we're like a time bomb
But I need it
Wouldn't have it any other way

Well, there's no way out of this, so let's stay in
Every storm that comes also comes to an end
Oh, resistance is useless
Just two kids stupid and fearless
Like a bullet shooting the lovesick
There's only one way down this road

It was like a time bomb set into motion
We knew that we were destined to explode
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you go
We're like a time bomb
Gonna lose it
Let's defuse it
Baby, we're like a time bomb
But I need it
Wouldn't have it any other way

Got my heart in your hands
Like a time bomb ticking
It goes off; we start again
When it breaks, we fix it
Got your heart in my hands
Like a time bomb ticking
We should know better
But we won't let go

It was like a time bomb set into motion
We knew that we were destined to explode
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you let me go

Paramore,In The Mourning,Singles Club,12/05/2011,"You escaped like a runaway train
Off the tracks and down again
And my heart's beating like a steam boat tugging

All your burdens
On my shoulders

And in the mourning, I'll rise
In the mourning, I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my worries

And now there's nothing but time that's wasted
And words that have no backbone
And now it seems like the whole world's waiting

Can you hear the
Echoes fading?

In the mourning, I'll rise
In the mourning, I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorries

And it takes all my strength
Not to dig you up
From the ground in which you lay
The biggest part of me
You were the greatest thing
And now you're just a memory
To let go of

And in the mourning, I'll rise
And in the mourning, I'll let you die
In the mourning all my sorries
In the mourning, I'll rise
In the mourning, I'll let you die
In the mourning all my sorries"
The Menzingers,Freedom Bridge,On the Impossible Past,02/20/2012,"Amy was a waitress at The Fire Street Grill
Up route 6-11, she was slaving for the pill
Oxy's got her pupils pinned up, a junkie centerfold
With grey hairs and a death wish, she was 22 years old

Had it all, took the fall
Had it all, took the fall

Specialist Jeg, a much more honest man than you
Came back from the desert where he never found the truth
Now he screeches tires, fills his head with alcohol
While the morbid brown faces hang like portraits on the wall

Had it all, he took the fall
Had it all, they took it all

Something happened on the way to hell
The new guard, they took my sister
Something happened on the way to hell
The old guard, they took my brother away
Something happened on the way to hell
The same greed, it took our parents
Something happened on the way to hell
The west wall, it took us with it

McTiernan was a good ol' boy, he cheated and he skimmed
""A favor for a favor, it can't be called a sin""
Some may see it different, and some don't see at all
When the papers started calling, he closed his eyes and took the fall

Had it all, took the fall
Had it all, took the fall

Now we're standing on the ledge and we're looking at the ground
I feel my body breaking on the asphalt, hear the sound
Red and blue lights screaming saying step up off that ledge
So we wrap our hearts up in our heads and take the fall instead

Had it all, took the fall
Had it all, took the fall

Something happened on the way to hell
The new guard, they took my sister
Something happened on the way to hell
The old guard, they took my brother away
Something happened on the way to hell
The same greed, it took our parents
Something happened on the way to hell
The west wall, it took us with it
Something happened on the way to hell
The west wall, it took us with it"
The Menzingers,Gates,On the Impossible Past,02/20/2012,"I am the pain that beats through your temples
Every morning when you wake up
I am the boy with alcohol poisoning
From all the parties Chris was throwing
That summer that they took us in
Like every other American
For getting drunk round the back of the Lions' Club
Waiting for the shitty bands to finish up
And some kids played hacky sack while the others just got high

It's not hard to fall for a waitress
When you both smoke, smoke the same cigarettes
You'll get seated as diner's lovers
She'll get the check as friends for the better
You'll carve your names into the Paupack cliffs
Just to read them when you get old enough to know
That happiness is just a moment

So, I'm marching up to your gates today
To throw my lonely soul away
'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back
So, I'm marching up to your gates today
To throw my lonely soul away
'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back

And they will make examples out of us
Like when they caught you in the CVS parking lot
But I fed the liars, I fed the liars
I fed the liars everything I got, everything I got
In my cabinet brain of canned thought
It was everything I got, oh everything I got
In my cabinet brain, in my cabinet brain

So, I'm marching up to your gates today
To throw my lonely soul away
'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back
So, I'm marching up to your gates today
To throw my lonely soul away
'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back

I hope the floor holds this time
We'll dance in subtle romance together
While we're making our time
While we're making our time
While we make our time
I saw the knife, now I'm leaning forwards
Straight city light cut me down to size
The bums are scheming on their Tall Boys
I can hardly open my eyes
Ava are you trying to get high?
I hope the floor holds this time
We'll dance in subtle romance together
While we're making our time
While we're making our time
While we make our time
I saw the knife, now I'm leaning forwards
I'm two wheels barreling down your way
You can't touch us, we're untouchable
Lament the beginnings that we celebrate
Never afraid, we're fearless together
The rest, they're waiting their lives away
Gold has us slurring and pissing out windows
Enemies are so far away
We're alive
Celebrate

The Menzingers,Burn After Writing,On the Impossible Past,02/21/2012,"Here's to you, the same chords that I stole
From a song that I once heard
The same melody I borrowed from the void
I'd rather observe than structure a narrative
The characters are thin
The plot does not develop
It ends where it begins
It's on the screen, in paperbacks
In section 8 and cul-de-sacs
Electro haikus and drunk sonnets
Are moving me along
Along
You cut my hair
You left red ink everywhere
Do my hands tell a story?
Is it boring?
You cut my hair
You left red ink everywhere
Do my hands tell a story?
Is it boring you?
What I'd give to force your sigh
What I'd give to see you cry
What I'd give for your caress
To see your blue cotton dress
Balled up on the floor
Certain memories are the problem
Certain drunken lines are the shame
Seven hundred miles and four years
I can't fight the flame; it burns
And it burns and it burns and it burns
You cut my hair
You left red ink everywhere
Do my hands tell a story?
Is it boring?
You cut my hair
You left red ink everywhere
Do my hands tell a story?
Is it boring you?

Was I wishing on satellites?
Tell me how you've been doing that trick
I'm just wishing the flame away
Now I'm wishing the flame away"
The Menzingers,Casey,On the Impossible Past,02/21/2012,"Well, I sat and thought about you
On the long ride back to Philly
From the way that you'd wear your hair
From the way that you'd laugh when you drank too much
Before the plug was pulled, the fires burned out
And all the parties grew bored
You waited tables and I waited for your shift breaks

And Gin and Casey
Used to dance inside of me
And I bet I sound like a broken record
Every time I open my mouth
I want to wander around the city with you again
Like when you waited tables
And I waited for your shift breaks

Me and Casey
We used to get drunk before we did the dishes
Oh, every evening
Me and Casey
Used to get high and listen to our boredom
'Cause it was so much easier
'Cause it was so much easier
Than dealing with everything

So Casey, Casey, Casey
Just tell me when you're ready, I'm all packed to go
To search for that old place we found forever ago
We could take my car 'cause she's still got the spirit
We could live, we could live, we could live
And no longer just have to hear it

Me and Casey
We used to get drunk before we did the dishes
Oh, every evening
Me and Casey
Used to get high and listen to our boredom
'Cause it was so much easier
'Cause it was so much easier

Well, the silence hasn't been broken
As we reach the point of utter disgust
As the weeks drag on, the lies unfold
The alcohol loses its touch
And I once held your words close to my heart
With a knife protecting all of them
But now we've made our beds in a deep, dense forest
We're sound, we'll never take the blame

As I dig my hands in the cold, dark dirt
In a search for what's now lost forever
With one last great hope of a messiah
I check the time and admit to the surrender terms
Remember the days when I had a conscience? Yeah, me neither
And I'm warning, I'm warning, I'm warning you
And I'm warning, I'm warning, I'm warning you

That I can't seem to tell
I can't seem to tell, I can't seem to tell

And drink with on random neighbors' porch steps
Our glossy eyes painted portraits of the streets

You were an old friend that covered up your innocence
With bad tattoos of all the bands you loved in high school
The ones you said that I had to listen to all the time

I did what I did to get away from this
'Cause everything that's happened has left me a total wreck
And everything that I do now is meaningless
So I'm off to wander around the world for a little bit
Without one hundred channels with nothing on the TV
And the great pessimistic unknown

So does anyone know the best way to go?
Which road that I could take to get to Mexico?
'Cause I'm so sick of living in this ditch
With only the memory in the back of my head
I'm on cruise control and the radio was on
Yeah, they were playing that song
That we both learned on our Mexican guitars
I'm on cruise control and the radio was on

At the gate, there is an automated teller machine
Sir, empty your pockets, please, before you
Before you file through
The king and queen foreclosed on their crowns
While the joker laughed and made his rounds
He was drunk, carrying on self-satisfied

The western walls are closing in
Are you happy, sane, are you rich, are you thin?
Dreaming their dreams? Singing songs of another time?
Is your gold so strangely acquired?
Has your name become known and desired?
Have you degenerated? Are you running out of time?

Do you want nice things? Sure you do
Do you call nice things your own?
Do you want nice things? Sure you do
Do you call nice things your own?

Disremember all we knew
Said we wanted to be interesting

These days you'll find me where the nectar's plenty
Looks are cheap and the talk is heavy
Where liars lie to themselves
Liars lie to themselves
I remember

You said, ""Sometimes I need you around""
And you said that my conveniences are so convenient
You said you wanted to be interesting

Where we were waiting impatiently
For a decent night's sleep
It's like I've landed in the rubble of my past life
And I never seem to board a return flight
From the shame, the fear, the guilt that's tough to mention
The kind that always pry your eyelids open
And I'm pretty sure this corner of the world
Is the loneliest corner in the whole world
Maybe it's me or the bartender
This Budweiser or the other customers
When all eyes are glued on the 6 o'clock news
For another fire and another impending deer season
I will leave you alone
And you will leave me alone

With picture-perfect imagery
Maybe I'm not dying
I'm just living in decaying cities
But I'm still healthy, I'm still fine

'Cause I remember every sunset (Well I remember)
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye (No way)
Singing la-da-da-da-da
Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you (Yeah)
And I'll be there in a heartbeat

I remember where we first kissed (I remember)
And how I didn't wanna leave your lips
And how I've never ever felt so high (So high)
Singing la-da-da-da-da
So tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you (Yeah)
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
(Quick time, quick time girl) Oh-oh
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
(Quick time, quick time girl)  Oh-oh
Summer paradise, baby
I'll be there in a heartbeat
Yeah"
Joyce Manor,Bride of Usher,Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired,04/14/2012,"If all your old posters of co-worker friends
Could know how it feels by now
Would they act like they don't have a clue?
You steer with your shoulders
And line your eyes with both of your arms
You send out for questions on note cards
When I say the answer's no, no

I don't remember the time
Collecting interest
And no, I don't remember anyone I haven't seen for years
I don't remember being anywhere
Anywhere but here

When you come to me with offers, I'll easily refuse
Could never hold me to trying
But hey, don't you think it's the least you could do
And maybe it's better that you are how you are
And it's something like you that has me falling apart
While I'm hard pressed into you in the back of your car
With your keys digging into your side

Reminds you of the time
Collecting interest
And no, I don't remember anyone I haven't seen for years
I don't remember being anywhere
Anywhere but here"
Joyce Manor,Comfortable Clothes,Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired,04/14/2012,"I've got something to tell you
Something that you'd say if you were me
But something so specific to you and only you
And when you heard it from another you looked so confused

Because ""I'm the one"" feels so alone
Comfortable clothes all on your own

And now that you're everywhere I'm off to
I don't even want to be around
I'll never be a letter in your every other and
Or a photo in a frame on the night stand

Because ""I'm the one"" feels so alone
Comfortable clothes all on your own

I feel so alone"
Joyce Manor,Drainage,Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired,04/14/2012,"I saw maybe something you could lust for in a tired way

Joyce Manor,If I Needed You There,Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired,04/14/2012,"To see you reach from the stairs saying
""I know this consumes me.""

I could just cry like a child
While kind of watching some movie about I'd like you to care
If I needed you there

If I needed you there
If I needed you there
If I needed you there
If I needed you there

So we should go to the park, the one that's flooded and ugly
Yeah, we should meet there tonight
Where nearly everything's sunken into the earth
As it turns toward a whorish instruction
Something I'd like you to share
If I needed you there

If I needed you there
If I needed you there
If I needed you there
If I needed you there"
Joyce Manor,I'm Always Tired,Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired,04/14/2012,"I'm always tired
I'm always at least half asleep
Blemish and state how I don't feel great now
I don't hang out in her hair
I don't wonder if she cares
I lay awake now, I entertain my plans
To one day miraculously be talkative and likable
To wake up as someone else, someone I know is inside of me
Just waiting to be put to use by something much more sharp than us
They pry out every fucking piece and still they're coming around again"
Joyce Manor,See How Tame I Can Be,Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired,04/14/2012,"I'm right here
But hey don't worry 'bout it
I don't care
Learning to do without it
Laying on the couch and staring at the wall like nothing
Like nothing at all

See how tame I can be?
In the reflection, I watch myself watching TV
And it's too much to take and so I say to myself
""I never told you that I loved you cause I don't.""

See how strange I can seem?
Did I ever tell you about that one dream?
Well look, there we are
Where we used to be
Of all things I will soon grow tired

Don't stop by
No, you don't have to be around tonight
If you're not feeling like it
Stand out in the hallway, fall into my arms
Because I want you
Can't you tell at all?"
Joyce Manor,These Kind of Ice Skates,Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired,04/14/2012,"You can't make, you can't make a mistake
On these kind of ice skates
You can talk, I'll lay around
So don't you be my black plastic case for your glasses
You fail to feel time affect you
And I don't think your confusing refusal to heal
With all your selfishness singing, ""I know how, I know how you feel"""
Joyce Manor,Violent Inside,Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired,04/14/2012,"Some TV tonight
You don't say I don't stand too close
Because I never, I never, I never, I never
I never learned how to act out
And you'll go looking for an excuse to feel sad
Sad or confused
When all you want to do is
Let them all, let them all feel abuse

You take a letter
Take an ""I"", take an ""s""
Form a stupid sentence and I'm not impressed
You take a person that's so well dressed
And I will feel violent because I feel violent all the time
Inside of me"

Flashback 1984
Now who's knock-knocking at your door?
A thought that starts a riot
They're coming after me now
Life is not the same
I am one
But sparks turn into flames

Will you take what's in my head?
And erase me when I'm dead?
'Cause the future is now
Now I'm disappearing
The day has turned to night
Can you save me from the light?
'Cause the future is here
This is how I disappear

Running down a spiral
With the light of better men
Shouting progress is survival
Take one last look and see me
Now you see me, now you don't
No vow to break
No string of hope
My hero, your pariah
They're coming after me now
Life is just God's game
I am one
But sparks turn into flames

And you get what you deserve
When revenge is what you serve
'Cause the future is now
Now I'm disappearing
I'll sink into the night
And I'm turning off the lights
'Cause the future is here
This is how I disappear

So the end's what you make it

And we all start again
What you had and what you lost
They're all memories in the wind
Those days go by

Seasons change overnight
As we find our way, the times, they come and go
Look back in love
A new day rises above
With a wind that comes to carry you back home

Those days go by

What you might have been like
How it would have felt to hold you
Would you have my eyes?
Don't you think we would've been best friends?

You would be ten and I'd be
Driving you to school
You would tell all your friends
That you thought I was cool
And you would have
All the love in my heart
Yeah, you would have
All the love in my heart

We were twenty-two years young then
Breaking rules all around
We were moving in that first apartment
It felt like it was never gonna end
Both so lost and crazy
We were young so we ran
Now I live in a dream where I am
Holding your little hands
I never got to meet you, my best friend

You would be ten and I'd be
Driving you to school
You would tell all your friends
That you thought I was cool
You would be out in the sun
Until it was gone
You would be watching Star Wars
With your PJs on
And you would have
All the love in my heart
Yeah, you would have

Deserve one of your own
A melody, a song about the life that you let go

Yes, I miss you still
And probably always will
I'm living with a busted heart that I will have until
I find the strength I know
Is somewhere in my bones

To show the faithless what we've done
And there's a fire inside

Here in this angel city lights will shine
And for a while we let ourselves go blind
But now we know who loves and loves us not
And they're worth every good thing we have lost

And there's a fire inside

All that is said has been said (has been said)
I'm waiting for another day, another way
I don't believe that you can make all the pain go away
So I'll leave it all behind, but I'm leaving with blood in my eyes

Seen through the lines, while believing the lies
For too long a time
And I still don't know how I did
And now war's declared, drawing the battle lines
And I can't see straight anymore
With all of this blood in my eyes

There's nothing to say now
The feelings are already dead (they're dead)
And I don't believe theres a way now

NOFX,72 Hookers,Self Entitled,09/11/2012,"They don't hate us, they just hate their lives
And desperate people learn to despise
The suicidals don't want a coup
They don't want to blow up, they just want their 72

72 virgins can never stop a war
But a 100,000 hookers can beat the Marine Corps
In stopping hatred, fighting will cease
When everyone is getting blow jobs
That's when we'll finally have world peace

How many million men have been killed in foreign wars?
We need to reinstate the draft, enlist a million whores
Start with the sororities and then all the spring breaks
Ship the girls gone wild to Afghanistan
They'll gladly blow the sheiks

These holy wars aren't holy, it's not the military complex
Terrorists are 16 year old kids who were promised Jihad sex
Maybe if they could see a woman's face
They might not get onto that plane
With a bomb in their suitcase

72 virgins can never stop a war
But a 100,000 hookers can beat the Marine Corps
In stopping violence, fighting will cease
When everyone is getting blow jobs
That's when we'll finally have world peace"

I parted with my Neurosis
But I kept The Lookouts
I got the record player, but I didn't get the house
I got one Black Flag ""Damaged""
And one ""Golden Shower of Hits.""
I left The Misfits coffin set
But I fuckin' kept The Spits
Now I got ""Group Sex"" and ""No Control.""
I got ""Suffer"" and ""Let's Go.""
I left ""Freedom of Choice"" with ""The Guilt Show.""
I knew it was over when I put on ""Walk Among Us"",
You grabbed the TV remote control
You put on Survivor and I put on some headphones
And cheated with my first love rock and roll
I took back my Replacements
And grabbed my Etherteen
Bullet, Nihilistics, and the banned ""God Save the Queen""
This wasn't like the Faith/Void
This was a clean split
If I didn't grab my records may all been smashed to bits
Take your Guns N' Roses with the Robert Williams cover
And I'll take the Fugazi picture disc
19 or 20 years ago I labeled my slip covers
That was a union I wasn't willing to risk"

Little else but memories of you on memory foam
Visions of a brighter love, I'd kill for one more day
To pool my thoughts and find the words to say

Because I don't sleep at all without you pressed up against me

Paying dues to every moment wasted on words left unsaid
Collisions of a finer love, I'd kill for one more way
To tell you how you make me better every day

The shadow of a ghost in an old haunt
With a lease on life 'cause I can't afford to own

A new place saves face or so I'm told
Be the new kid on an old block
A chalk outline on a playground blacktop

I'm just a moment so don't let me pass you by
We could be a story in the morning but we'll be a legend tonight
I'm just a moment so don't let me pass you by
And they can speak our names in a dead language
'Cause you and I, we're alive
But just for a moment

I'm twice the man that I thought I was yesterday
Half the time, I'm a world away
A flicker of a soul casting silhouettes
On the face of a town that could not get me to stay
And when the spark's gone, former lovers
Just looking for a bus to throw me under

To create the illusion that our lives are not vacant
But still our hearts are so shattered
We are all speeding with no destination
An imaginary prize until we sadly falter

Hollow children sputtering out
From birth until failure, we march on forever
We are only as strong as the mark we left behind

It was a cold, cold day in December
Your hands were folded
Your heart was silent
What was this boy to you?
How could I possibly stay here without you?
You were a young soul waiting forever
And heaven had finally come for you
I know this much is true
They'll never another one like you

Hollow children sputtering out
From birth until failure, we march on forever
We are only as strong as the mark we left behind

Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm
And you never really know where it goes up until it starts
I got my eye on you
Whatcha gonna do
Day dream near a stream with the linear bites
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night
And I can't picture you but I sure got the feeling right
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl

And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news
And you reached for my hand, I was scared in your room
We fell on the floor and we started to move
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop
Up my back they would climb just as I came unglued

She said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be there to try it again

Nineteen as we roll across the bedroom floor
Your eyes they cannot lie as you're dreaming of our future home
And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl

In the rain with the drink from the back of the bar
I would raise up my voice, you would raise it up more
We'd forget that our lives being apart, it is hard
We'd thought we were close but it still feels far
Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars
If we learn to forgive and accept who we are

If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to do it again

Wait a minute, hold up a second
Don't leave me here with this feeling
Like I'm the one full of regret
Like I never did good for us both
Like you never did pull out that weapon
And stick that knife in my back
Was I supposed to accept it
When your words are like
More than just sticks and stones
Kinda like a bullet
A hollow tip that lodged in my bones
And I can't just swallow it
My pride is more than all that I own
So I gotta give it away
And some of the times I'm all the way wrong
But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along
To the song I write til I'm alone at night
And I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
Cause I know that me and you is just only right but one one one one...

It's a cry from the past, we have been through a lot
Every year has been great and a few have been tough
And your kids, they will reach for the stars up above
We'll sit and relax as we're cheering them on
The ropes to the light from the crib to the grave
We started alone, in the end we're okay

You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight

Fall Out Boy,My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light 'Em Up),Save Rock and Roll,02/04/2013,"B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark

The writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark

My songs know what you did in the dark
(My songs know what you did in the dark)

So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire

I wanna be a painting for all to see, let's go
Take a trip, take a big hand full of these and swallow
Just a headache, a fuzzy memory tomorrow
I wanna be a Warhol hanging on your wall
You down there looking up at me
I wanna be a Warhol displayed on your wall
Hung up there staring back at you
Staring back at you
Give me a taste of your misery, let's go
Won't you please come play chemistry and sorrow
I can't believe anything that you're telling me, let's go
The walls are closing in and melting nice and slow
I wanna be a Warhol hanging on your wall
You down there looking up at me
I wanna be a Warhol displayed on your wall
Hung up and staring back at you
Staring back at you
I wanna be a Warhol hanging on your wall
Staring down at you
I wanna be a Warhol displayed on your wall
Still hung up on you"

Paramore,Still into You,Paramore,03/14/2013,"Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

Cause after all this time, I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time I'm still into you

Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever

And after all this time, I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time I'm still into you

Some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time
I'm into you
Baby not a day goes by
That I'm not into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time I'm still into you

I'm still into you

The Wonder Years,Passing Through a Screen Door,The Greatest Generation,03/27/2013,"Cigarette smoke dances back in the window
And I can see the haze on the dome light
I'm conjuring ghosts on a forty-hour ride home
And they keep asking me what I'm doing with my life
While my cousins go to bed with their wives
I'm feeling like I've fallen behind

Well, the highway won
I'm listening to traffic reports one on one
Coming quietly undone
I was born to run
Away from anything good
An escape artist's son
Sun-drenched pavement in my blood
The first thing that I do when I walk in
Is find a way out for when shit gets bad, and

I've been looking for
Tears in the screen door (Tears in the screen door)
I've been waiting for
Another disaster (Another disaster)

Well I'm terrified
Like a kid in the sixties
Staring at the sky
Waiting for the bomb to fall
And it's all a lie
What they say about stability
It scares me sometimes
The emptiness I see in my eyes
And all the kids' names I've ever liked
Are tied to tragedy
And I don't want my children growing up to be
Anything like me

I've been looking for
Tears in the screen door (Tears in the screen door)
I've been waiting for
Another disaster (Another disaster)
And I was kinda hoping you'd stay
I was kinda hoping you'd stay

I keep a flashlight
And a small knife
In the corner of my bed stand
I keep a flashlight
And the train times
But you wouldn't understand
How could you understand?
Jesus Christ, I'm twenty-six
All the people I graduated with
All have kids
All have wives
All have people who care if they come home at night
Well, Jesus Christ, did I fuck up?

I've been looking for
Tears in the screen door (Tears in the screen door)
I've been waiting for
Another disaster (Another disaster)
And I was kinda hoping you'd stay
I was kinda hoping you'd stay
I was kinda hoping you'd stay"

Trophy Eyes,Chacho,Demo 2013,04/08/2013,"The sun is over our heads again
I'll never know how many days it's been
Since school went out and summer came in
Breaking into the pool at 3.a.m
And I know I swore id never turn eighteen
But as the days march on my words get hard to keep
I'll watch the summer sun set in my two hands
And I'll hold it there forever, forever my friends
The road ahead looks cold and lonely
Youth left us for dead
I came to shake the world with my words
To make some sense of all the years we spent
Bearing the weight of our own expectations
Dreams built with bare hands
Did I do all that I could do with my time
How can we say that we were unprepared
I made the best of all the chances given
But we grew up too fast
That place that we once knew is gone
We left it there nothing but a hole in the ground
It wasn't where that we came from
It always felt like when that we called home
Those two years they made us who we are
They made us family and brought us this far
We ripped our skin so we can't shake it off
We march on and tell our story's by our scars
The road ahead looks cold and lonely
Youth left us for dead
I came to shake the world with my words
To make some sense of all the years we spent
Bearing the weight of our own expectations
Dreams built with bare hands
Did I do all that I could do with my time
How can we say that we were unprepared
I made the best of all the chances given
But we grew up too fast
Every day spent searching for nothing
A shred of respect I never seen
We meant nothing to no one, invisible me
Were the kids your parents pray you don't grow up to be
Every day, they pray
The road ahead looks cold and lonely
Youth left us for dead

Trophy Eyes,Personal Taste,Demo 2013,04/08/2013,"You can come with me or drown
Let your insecurities pull you down
I'm not waiting any longer for you
While you sit in your mess and wait for miracles to
Take you back
Drinking on your own is only bringing you down
We've all passed you by years but your still around
It's time to grow up get out of this fucking town
But you're too busy on your own forgetting dignity counts
Your life's been slipping through your hands since we left
You never paid much attention but it hurts more to pretend
Cause one day you will wake and realised all you had was the chance to let it all go or stay true to your friends
But you slipped again
I can tell by your vacant expression that the years spent in your head haven't treated you kind
And what we all wouldn't give just to listen once more before the tape unwinds
It gets easier to just let go than watch everything you love slip through your hands
I guess it's better off as memories
But you'll have to grow up to understand
You'll have to grow up to understand
Drinking on your own is only bringing you down
We've all passed you by years but your still around
It's time to grow up get out of this fucking town
But you're too busy on your own forgetting dignity counts
Your ignorance a vessel that has run aground
I'm were so sick of your lies you've grown close to the sound
I couldn't care any less for the safety you've found
Surrounded by your stories with your head in the clouds
You'll have to grow up to understand
You'll have to grow up to understand"

Daydreaming into the night
And I'm alright

It's not that I won't remember where I'm from
Just don't want to be here no more
It's not enough
(We're only half alive)
I'm going to go
(We're only half alive)
Where the rest of the dreamers go
(We're only half alive)
Where the dreamers go

Daydreaming into the night
And I'm alright
Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time

We used to be half alive
Now I'm alright"
Paramore,Fast In My Car,Paramore,04/09/2013,"Been through the wringer a couple times
I came out callous and cruel
And my two friends know this very well
Because they went through it too
The three of us were initiates
We had to learn how to deal
And when we spotted a second chance
We had to learn how to steal

Hollowed out and filled up with hate
All we want is you to give us a break

We're driving fast in my car
We've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
No we're not looking for violence, no -oh-oh-oh
Tonight we want to have fun

No one's the same as they used to be
Much as we try to pretend
No one's as innocent as could be
We all fall short, we all sin
But now we aren't looking backward
We won't try raising the dead
We only see what's in front of us
We only see straight ahead

Hollowed out and filled up with hate
All we want is you to give us a break

We're driving fast in my car
We've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
No we're not looking for violence, no-oh-oh-oh
Tonight we want to have fun


Get in my car and we'll drive around
We'll make believe we are free
Already proved we can tough it out
And we get along so sweetly

We're driving fast in my car
We've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
No we're not looking for violence, no-oh-oh-oh
Tonight we want to have fun

We're driving fast in my car
We're driving fast in my car
No we're not looking for violence, no oh oh oh
We're driving fast in my car
And we want just to have fun"
Paramore,Future,Paramore,04/09/2013,"Yeah
That's how you had it, yeah
Pretty sure
It is, it goes clapping a bit
Something just in that way
Alright, here we go
Gonna go an octave down this time

I'm writing the future
I'm writing it out, loud
We don't talk about the past
We don't talk about the past now
So, I'm writing the future
I'm leaving a key here
Something won't always be missing
You won't always feel empty, here

Ah-ah, mm-mm
Ah-ah-ah-ah, mm-mm

Just think of the future
And think of your dreams
You'll get away from here
You'll get away eventually
So, just think of the future
Think of a new life
And don't get lost in the memories
Keep your eyes on a new prize

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Mm"
Paramore,Grow Up,Paramore,04/09/2013,"I told them all where to stick it
I left town with a dime to my name
I said, I'm done with all of my fake friends
Self-righteous pawns in a losing game
Got my band and a light that won't go out
Been burning since the day I was born
So I'll cry just a little then I'll dry my eyes
Cause I'm not a little girl no more

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind

Stood in line for so long just to picket
Something I will never understand
Aren't you tired of always being mad at the world?
Won't you just admit you don't care?
And lady, I don't want your pity
So don't feel sad for me
I got a love I would die for and a song to sing
Maybe we're both just living out our dream

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind

We get along for the most part
Me and reality, the light and the dark
We live alone, two different worlds
Me in a fantasy, you in your memories
But we get along
We get along (for the most part)
We get along (yeah, for the most part)
We get along (for the most part)
We get along
We get along, we get along

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind (leave you behind)
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind (leave you behind)
Some of us have to grow up sometimes (we grow up and never grow old)
And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes (we grow up and never grow old)
And so, if I have to I'm going to leave you behind"
Paramore,Hate To See Your Heart Break,Paramore,04/09/2013,"There is not a single word
In the whole world
That could describe the hurt
The dullest knife just sawing back and forth
And ripping through the softest skin there ever was

How were you to know?
Oh, how were you to know?

And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before

Love happens all the time
To people who aren't kind
And heroes who are blind
Expecting perfect scripted movie scenes
Who wants an awkward silent mystery?

How were you to know?
Well, how were you to know-oh-oh?

And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before

For all the air that's in your lungs
For all the joy that is to come
For all the things that you're alive to feel
Just let the pain remind you hearts can heal

Oh, how were you to know? (How were you to know?)
Oh, how were you to know?

And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I
I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before"
Paramore,Last Hope,Paramore,04/09/2013,"I don't even know myself at all
And I thought I would be happy by now
The more I try to push it I realize
Gotta let go of control

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
So let it happen

It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

Every night I try my best to dream
Tomorrow makes it better
Then I wake up to the cold reality
That not a thing has changed

But it will happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

And the salt in my wounds
Isn't burning any more than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood in these veins
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have
The only thing I know that's keeping me alive
Alive

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
(So if I let go of control now, I can be strong)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
(So if I keep my eyes closed, with the blind hope)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

Paramore,(One Of Those) Crazy Girls,Paramore,04/09/2013,"Now when you say you want to slow down
Does it mean you want to slow dance?
Maybe you just want a little extra time
To focus on our romance
What do you mean I got it backwards?
You know we're gonna be forever
Why are you telling me goodbye?
Aren't you gonna stay the night?

Are we really over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times

Now I walk under a pink sky (ooh)
Lovers float along and pass me by
I pour my heart out to your voice mail
Let you know I caught a bus to your side of town
And now I'm standing at your doorstep
With Los Angeles behind me
If you don't answer I'll just use the key that I copied
Cause I really need to see you

If you're not here when I break in
I'm gonna go through your closet
Just so I can smell your skin
As the chemicals swim
I know I'll never love again
I swear I'll never love again

Baby are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
As soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times


I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls

Paramore,Part II,Paramore,04/09/2013,"What a shame, what a shame we all remain
Such fragile broken things
A beauty half betrayed
Butterflies with punctured wings
Still there are darkened places deep in my heart
Where once was blazing light, now
There's a tiny spark

Oh glory
Come and find me
Oh glory
Come and find me'

Dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh glory

What a mess, what a mystery we've made
Of love and other simple things
Learning to forgive even when it wasn't a mistake
I question every human who won't look in my eyes
Scars left on my heart formed patterns in my mind

Oh glory
You will find me

Dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh glory


Like the moon we borrow our light
I am nothing but a shadow in the night
But if you let me I will catch fire
So let your glory and mercy shine"

I know it 'cause I feel it beating
So strong it'll knock you down
So strong, so strong

Over here
I can't count the miles away from where I want to be
I bet your skin is warm and that you're smiling
Yeah, that's what I always loved the most about you
You're so strong
Come and knock me down, hey

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am
Then I'll believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

I'll get in my car
Drive it faster than I ever did before
Head out west until I finally reach the shore
And then I'll swim out to wherever you are
And we'll ride the undercurrent down to the floor
Making friends with all the unfamiliar creatures
And pushing back on the unnecessary pressure
Come up for air just so you know we won't drown
You're so strong
The world can't keep us down, hey

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am

Choking on their halos
Get them drunk on rose water
See how dirty I can get them
Pulling out their fragile teeth
And clip their tiny wings

Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name
It will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name

Cue all the love to leave my heart
It's time for me to fall apart

Now you're gone
But I'll be okay
Your hot whiskey eyes
Have fanned the flame
Maybe I'll burn a little brighter tonight
Let the fire breathe me back to life

Baby, you were my picket fence
I miss missing you now and then
Chlorine kissed summer skin
I miss missing you now and then
Sometimes before it gets better
The darkness gets bigger
The person that you'd take a bullet for is behind the trigger
Oh
We're fading fast
I miss missing you now and then

Making eyes at this husk around my heart
I see through you when we're sitting in the dark
So give me your filth
Make it rough
Let me, let me trash your love

I will sing to you every day
If it will take away the pain
Oh and I've heard you got it, got it so bad
Cause I am the best you'll never have

Baby, you were my picket fence

She's his suicide blonde, she's number than gold

Are you ready for another bad poem?
One more off key anthem
Let your teeth sink in
Remember me as I was, not as I am

If I don't wake up dead""

This is where you come to beg, unborn and unshaven
Killing fields of fire to a congress of ravens
This is what we do baby, we nightmare you

I'm about to make the sweat roll backwards
And your heartbeat in reverse
Our guts can't be reworked
As alone as a little white church
In the middle of the desert getting burned

I sing a bitter song
I'm the lonelier version of you

He says ""I've seen bigger""
She says ""I've lived better""
And they throw the matches down into the glitter
Not a dry eye left in the house
Go boy, go boy, run for your life

The Wonder Years,Dismantling Summer,The Greatest Generation,04/16/2013,"I'm pulling wings off insects
I'm peeling back my sunburnt skin
I'll wait outside your bedroom
I hope they let me in
I'm filling your prescriptions
The orange bottles stare me down
They're standing at attention
An army on your windowsill
We're all waiting for good news
Hoping you can come home soon
We're all waiting for good news

I've been acting like I'm strong
But the truth is, I've been losing ground
To a hospital too crowded
A summer winding down
I hadn't seen a heart break until now
I hadn't felt a heartbreak until now

I grew up on your back porch
And I watched the storms light up the clouds
They hung like paper lanterns
To guide the way back toward your house
I've been putting off long flights
Hoping that you'll be all right
And I'll be there in the meantime

I've been acting like I'm strong
But the truth is, I've been losing ground
To a hospital too crowded
A summer winding down
I hadn't seen a heart break until now

And you're in a hospital bed
Well, then, what kind of man does that make me?

The Wonder Years,The Devil in My Bloodstream,The Greatest Generation,05/13/2013,"We wiped out all the Buffalo
Around the turn of the last century
And so it's factories and sawgrass
Wheat fields and asphalt laid in front of me
The Midwest feels like a hollow place
That we filled with love and industry
And we're staring at the frozen ground in Goodwill suits
Silent as the pastor reads the eulogy
Well I wanted to see just a little bit of everything
Let me be

Two blackbirds on a highway sign
Are laughing at me at four in the morning
They played the war drum out of time
So I'm not sure where I've been marching
I wanna be strong, but it's not easy anymore
I'm hoping I'm wrong

It's sixteen hours straight to home
From the heart of North Missouri
And so I searched through my great-grandpa's memoirs
For the devil in my bloodstream
Depression grabbed his throat
And choked the life out of him slowly
I've got the same blood coursing through my veins
And it'll come for me eventually

I bet I'd be a fucking coward
I bet I'd never have the guts for war
Cause I can't spend another month away from here
These frantic rest stop phone calls don't get answered anymore
But I, I wanted to know if I could please come home
So let me know

They played the war drum out of time
So I'm not sure where I've been marching
I wanna be strong, but it's not easy anymore

I'm hoping I'm wrong

I know how it feels to be
At war with a world
That never loved me

The Wonder Years,Cul-de-sac,The Greatest Generation,05/14/2013,"I've been leaving messages
On an answering machine
In a house that's always empty, so I know nobody's listening
I've been confessing my transgressions over tape hiss
The silence makes me sick
No good can come from this

I've been hanging on like poison ivy
Out of cold suburban concrete
From this careless urban sprawl
I'm letting go
You know we can't keep out of trouble
I thought my kids would call you uncle
I thought we'd never be alone

Well I got images
Of you inside my head
Outside of the gas station where we always used to shoplift
It's car-crash rhetoric
We fucked up everything we came in contact with
Just boyhood recklessness

Of snow angels and gut laughs
If you walked me home
But you won't, you're all alone
On some bullshit, pill-bottle vision quest
If you walked me home
Well, I don't know when I would finally
Work up the backbone
To walk alone

I'm letting go
'Cause I loved you

The Wonder Years,I Just Want to Sell Out My Funeral,The Greatest Generation,05/14/2013,"Clear the apartment
I plan on collapsing and I could have sworn I heard a car door slam
I'm stuck at the corner of grinding teeth and stomach acid
All alone under a soft rain and streetlamp
I spent my life weighed down by a stone heart
Drowning in irony and settling for anything
Somewhere down the line all the wiring went faulty
I'm scared shitless of failure and I'm staring out at where I wanna be

I just want to sell out my funeral
I just want to be enough for everyone
I just want to sell out my funeral
Know that I fought until the lights were gone

I'm walking through harbors and churchyards
I felt the snow crack under my feet
I'll stay thankful for mild winters, for every shot I got at anything
I'll blame the way that I was brought up or the flaws that I was born with
Or the mistakes that I've made
They're all just fucking excuses
So bury me in the memories of my friends and family
I just need to know that they were proud of me

I just want to sell out my funeral
I just want to be enough for everyone
I just want to sell out my funeral
Know that I fought until the lights were gone

And oh, we all wanna know
Where'd the American dream go?
Did you give up and go home?
Am I here alone?
And oh, when the credits roll
I'll watch as the screen glows
The moments when I choked, all the fears that I've outgrown
At least I hope so

I was just happy to be a contender
I was just aching for anything
And I used to have such steady hands
But now I can't keep them from shaking

Oh I'm sorry I...
I'm sorry I don't laugh at the right times
Is this what it feels like with my wings clipped?
I'm awkward and nervous
I'm awkward and nervous
I'm awkward and nervous
I'm awkward and nervous
I'm awkward and nervous

But I was kind of hoping you'd stay
I was kind of hoping you'd stay
I was kind of hoping you'd stay
I need you to stay
Oh, god, could you stay?
I need you to stay
I need you to stay
I need you

I'm staring up at the sky
But the bombs keep fucking falling
There's no devil on my shoulder
He's got a rocking chair on my front porch
But I won't let him in
No, I won't let him in

'Cause I'm sick of seeing ghosts
And I know how it's all gonna end
There's no triumph waiting
There's no sunset to ride off in

I know about the devil in your bloodstream
I know that the ghosts still visit nightly
I know it must get lonely by the Chesapeake
And Madelyn, are you really afraid of death
Or do you just say it if it's the right thing to say?
Madelyn, I know you're safe where you lay your head
But if you wanted to come back, I've got a place you could stay
If I'm not doing right by my family
Then what's the point of it anyway?

With a fuse that's still lit

I'm watching shorebirds circle in real close

(I left because you asked me to)

Operator, take me home, I don't know where else to go
I wanna die in the suburbs
A heart attack shoveling snow all alone
If I die, I wanna die in the suburbs

These northeast winters make boys into men
Staring out at snow-plowed mountains
In the parking lots of churches
The city just felt worn out
No strength to pick our hearts off the ground
We watched the '92 Birds take the field without Jerome Brown

A Day to Remember,City of Ocala,Common Courtesy,10/08/2013,"Fuck yeah!

Remember way back when? They said this life was a dream
Well it still is, I never wanna wake
Standing in my backyard at our old practice space
Hard to hold back the tears from streaming down my face

That was then, this is now
You can't run before you go learn how, and you won't

This is our corner of the world
Where we can come to be ignored
This is our point where we return
This is where I came from
This is where I came from

Remember way back when? This place seemed bigger to me
Learned how to play guitar, and made my mom watch me
We always knew back then, just where I'd be right now
We never questioned it, was more like when and how

That was then, this is now
You can't run before you go learn how, and you won't

This is our corner of the world
Where we can come to be ignored
This is our point where we return
This is where I came from
This is what made us who we became
Where they know me, not just my name
There's not another place the same
This is where I came from
This is where I came from
Yeah!

You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us
Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough
Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around
You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us
Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough
Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around

A Day to Remember,I Remember,Common Courtesy,10/08/2013,"I'd never wish any of this on anyone or anything
Aw come on, you gotta try and look at things like me
I never needed anything I got
I never keep anything I have, what do I have?
Mostly things that'll never last
Then I think back...

I remember when I first saw the country
I remember sleeping in the van
Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand
I remember jumping off of cliff tops
I remember playing with no one there
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been
Cause where I've been

They wonder why I hide myself from everyone
From everything, man come on
You wouldn't last a day as me
Everyone loves me for my past, but they always hate me in the present
Why can't you just meet me somewhere in the middle?
It's in the hardest times we grow the most

I remember when I first saw the country
I remember sleeping in the van
Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand
I remember jumping off of cliff tops
I remember playing with no one there
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been
Cause where I've been

Speeding up, to slow down
Side glances around this crowd all at me
There must be something I can't see, so tell me
Hold me up, help me out
As I circle around what makes me happy
There isn't one place that I can be without leaving
This is my life

I remember when I first saw the country
I remember sleeping in the van
Said goodbye to friends and family, cause they could never understand
They don't understand
They don't understand

I remember jumping off of cliff tops
I remember playing with no one there
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am
I remember the coast of California
I remember trucks stops cross the land
Never kept too many idols cause we were busy being them
I remember waking up in Georgia. I remember quitting my last job
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I was, where I've been
Cause where I've been"
A Day to Remember,Life Lessons Learned The Hard Way,Common Courtesy,10/08/2013,"Life lessons learned the hard way

Four people waited in a random white unmarked van
Parked outside your hotel high rise garage
To use a tire iron to break the bones inside your legs
Too bad you never came outside, that's all right
Cause in the end you'll get wrecked
Yeah, in the end, you'll get wrecked

I heard a little girl killed herself today
That blood's on your hands (It's on your hands)
When everyone knows your face, nothing's safe
You'll live your life as a fucking target

You've earned my disgust
You've earned my disgust"
A Day to Remember,Right Back at it Again,Common Courtesy,10/08/2013,"We're? coming out swinging!

Started out in the spring of 2003
Never went to school, nobody talked to me
Except to tell me all the things I couldn't do
Don't want to hear about it
Got with my guys packed into all our cars
Hit all the nearest scenes, and every local bar
I played a show a night 'till it made me sick

So here I am, I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said, if you're too cool for school
You ain't here to make no friends
And? I said hey (hey)
I'm right back at it again
Just like I have always said, you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends

Left home with no kinda backup plan
And everyone one that we knew that we couldn't stand
Said ""If you can't? make it here, you won't make it there""
Don't want to hear about it
Spent most of our nights sleeping on hardwood floors
People's living rooms, in any open door
Played a show at night 'till it all made sense

Don't wanna hear about it
Don't wanna hear about it, yeah

So here I am, I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said, if you're too cool for school
You ain't here to make no friends
And I said hey!
I'm right back at it again
Just like you'll always say, you're too cool for school
I ain't? here to make no...
Brace for impact

Don't wanna hear about it
Don't wanna hear about it
Bitch...

Something is so off!
Can we leave it this time?
What did you think?
I thought it was awesome. Leave the 'bitch' please?
You like the 'bitch?'
I've liked the 'bitch' since fucking Homesick"
A Day to Remember,Same Book But Never The Same Page,Common Courtesy,10/08/2013,"I've lost a part of me
'Cause I am just an open book for everyone to see
I always leave empty handed; I can't keep the things that mean the most to me

I might be temporarily blind but I'm not stupid

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face? (I've always wanted to know)
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place. (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it. I don't get it. Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down

I'd give you everything but that would never be good enough and that's alright with me
You take me for granted. I tried to help you be who you wanna be
I'm a sucker for a complication
Here goes another week it must seem
You weren't worth my time, you weren't worth my time
I still let you take it from me

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face? (I've always wanted to know)
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place. (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it. I don't get it. Nothing ever seems to work when you're around

Why do I always do this to myself?
Always depending on everyone else
You know it's going to drive me crazy
You're just a notch in the wall that made me

You break me down!
We never met on middle ground!
You break me..."
A Day to Remember,"Sometimes You're The Hammer, Sometimes You're The Nail",Common Courtesy,10/08/2013,"Start it
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me

Yo, I got it!

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling
Go get carried away

Go!

And the fears sets in, in an instant
Too much of myself gets exposed
This is where I go at my weakest
When I don't have to be scared to tell the truth

Tend to do my best when everything goes wrong
That's why sad songs make me happy, cause I don't have to feel alone

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling
No, you've got me wrong
Oh, the nights are long with no one else around
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Go get carried away

It's never what you've done, it's what you've done lately
Who cares what you're saying, if no ones listening
You don't have to like me, but you're gonna respect me
I that came from nothing, leave hope in my wake

I got no regrets, but have my days with doubt
To those left in sadness I'll be the one to lead you out

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling
No, you've got me wrong
Oh, the nights are long with no one else around
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Go get carried away

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable
Reserve my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgment
You don't make me who I am
I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable
Reserve my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgment
You don't make me who I am

God help those who help themselves
And forget about everyone else
You lost your nerve, you missed the point
God help those with open hands
May they never feel burdened again
Yeah, I'll stand up for those who can't
I'll close the distance"

Be careful, get your lawyers, 'cause you're gonna get sued!""

Where does your conscience run to hide?

I gotta get out, I gotta get out
Why can't you just do what's right by me?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out
It can't get much harder, harder to breathe

The room it keeps spinning faster, I'm drifting off to sleep
Hope it's seen beyond these walls you're suffocating me

Why can't you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home
Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight

How's living a lie?
You never could face me
And you hide behind fake personalities
Because deep down you're scared
So weak beyond compare

I gotta get out, I gotta get out
Why can't we just go our separate ways?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out
It won't be much farther, I'm counting the days

Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why

My friends still stand behind me
We stuck together through all we lost
Even when your worst surrounds me, you'll never get the best of us

AFI,A Deep Slow Panic,Burials,10/22/2013,"I watched you go out the door
With poison I've seen before
I saw you shine, you shine
I collapse to the floor
It promised it'd miss me more
And said true love, is mine
I missed you, did you miss me?
Slowly it's consuming me
Deliberate and deep
I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me, teach me not to dream
Dream deeply
I haven't left you for days
My panic keeps me awake
As he unwinds, inside
He told me I should have known
That he'd hated the way I'd grown
To love soft lies, she lied
Do you miss her like I missed you?
Slowly it's consuming me
Deliberate and deep
I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me, teach me not to dream
Dream deeply
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Slowly it's consuming me
Deliberate and deep
I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me, teach me not to dream
Dream deeply
Slowly, I swallowed your fears
Throughout all those years
How could you let them consume me?
Teach me, teach me how you sleep
So sweetly
Slowly, it's consuming me
Deliberate and deep
I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me, teach me how you sleep

And how it changed everything

And Christmas is coming, so don't buy me anything
I got what I wanted, I got what I needed
It's you

I don't mean to hold on to your love for so long
But the feeling is right and nothing can go wrong
The fog on the window, radio sings us songs
I can remember waking up in her arms
And I think back to when I was younger
When everyone's together and I want to more now than ever
To not think about our troubles cause


I hope there no ghost when I dream
Telling me to change everything they see
Falling back into my memories
Wake me up now to fall asleep with me
Wake me up now to fall asleep cause

To Oxford Street
Trying to right a wrong
Just walk away
Those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will
Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

Light up the fireworks in me

Last Friday night I wasn't me
I was a still life trapped in eternity
I was the focal point out of focus, out of ink
And I've been wandering nightly
Through the garden of your heartache
Always making a mess, always stumbling out the door
But, I don't wanna be an asshole anymore

Baby, baby I'll be good to you
I don't wanna be an asshole anymore
Baby, baby, I'll be good to you
Baby, baby, I'll be good to you

Another night, I devoured the sun
And plunged myself into the depths of oblivion
Yeah somewhere along the way I found wine
Feels damn good just to bleed sometimes
But all I ever wanted was to make things right
The years of idleness and spite
I push my emotions off a bridge
After taking them hostage with a shotgun
Now they're somewhere treading water
Somewhere lost inside the man that I'm not
But I don't wanna be an asshole anymore

And I won't pry no more
Over the people that you're hanging with
You're the only lover that I ever missed
Ever been hopelessly in love with
Look at this tangle of thorns
I don't wanna be an asshole anymore

Yeah, I don't wanna be an asshole anymore
Oh no, no, no"
The Menzingers,In Remission,Rented World,04/22/2014,"I've got a winning lotto ticket
From the state of Massachusetts
Tucked in the back of my wallet
I'll cash it when I'm back in Boston
With a blank eye from the cashier
For why it's torn and busted up

I remember that moment of silence
I was at a mall in Norwich
Shoppers stared at the ground
The escalators went on smoke breaks
Oh 1918, you've yet to see the worst of humans acting

Maybe the future's just a little bit weird
Maybe the God you love is all I've got to fear
Life's a terminal illness in remission
So I took the weight of it all out for a drink
And then we drove back, drunk
Through the busy city streets

I hate how I always get nervous
Every time I try to speak
In front of a big crowd
A pretty girl, or the police
And I hate the things that I know about you
And all the horrible things that you do

I don't want to be late for war today
I want to chew up my dinner and spit in your face
Light fire to your home and tap your cell phone
Oh yeah!

If everyone needs a crutch
Then I need a wheelchair
I need a reason to reason with you
If everyone needs a crutch
Then I need a wheelchair
I need a reason to reason with you
If everyone needs a crutch
Then I need a wheelchair
I need a reason to reason with you
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

We survived those churches and hospitals
Tall tales get taller, but they'll never grow old
Yours is a flame, it never goes out
A guiding light in the storm for our sinking hearts
Yours is the summer that will never end

Sleep now, it's only getting better, man
Sleep now, it's only getting better

Someday, we'll all die, some people never live
You lived the lives of a thousand men
Living from your feet, never from your knees
You are the earth, you are the sun
You are the light above, you are the air in our lungs
You are the earth beneath our feet

Sleep now, it's only getting better, man

The Menzingers,Nothing Feels Good Anymore,Rented World,04/22/2014,"I am a tiny fly, buzzing around in a field
Somewhere in the overgrowth of your memory
And at night you wander through
As the image of a former you
Searching every nook and every cranny
For the form that I'm taking

But baby, baby I'm right here!
I try to shout and scream and say
But my darling you just swat
You just swat me away
And in my greatest desperation
I dig deep into your skin
A little itch to keep the thought of me

But nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good

I'm at the party in a cloud of nicotine
Exhaled by drunk twentysomethings
There's a couple arguing in the bathroom
A couple kids just trying to get high
I try to make my way outside
'Cause I've got to see you tonight
I start pacing then running

""But baby, baby buzz me in!""
I ring your intercom and say
But you just poke your head through the curtain
And my heart's on the floor

But nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good

Like the dead cat in the alley
Like the garbage overturned
Like the uninviting orgy
On top of some dog shit in the yard
I had a life, I thought I had it together
I thought my house could never burn
But that was before, but that was before

Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good

Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good"

I don't have the guts to kick him out
In the bars where I live, lives someone
Who I would've hated when I was young
When I swore life had a purpose
When I was sure the whole things worth it
Damn the days we took for granted
Never again will I let anyone close to me

Me and the rodent in the wall have more in common after all

So burn the fucker down, I don't care anymore
I'll let it all go
Cause if this is what you want, I understand
Good luck with the guilt left on your hands
I've tried running, I've tried hiding
I've tried everything but dying
Damn the days we took for granted
Never again will I let anyone close to me

Yeah, me and the rodent in the wall have more in common after all

I am only bad news, news for you"
The Menzingers,Transient Love,Rented World,04/22/2014,"I used to lie to myself all the time
I was always over-reacting, screaming ""I'm gonna die.""
But now I'm five thousand miles from a head on my shoulder
From a night I spent sober, screaming ""I'm gonna die.""

But all I ever wanted was to make things right
All I ever wanted was to make things right

Transient love, I was a ghost on your birthday
I was a runaway, somewhere in a grave of mistakes
Transient love, you should've seen the view from the mansion
It made me think of things we never mentioned
The things we're too afraid to say

Like what if I spend the next few years
Just somewhere in some atmosphere
While you're at home with bills to pay
I hope it doesn't end this way

All I ever wanted was to make things right
All I ever wanted was to make things right
Over and over in my head I tried
But all I ever wanted was to make things right"
The Menzingers,When You Died,Rented World,04/22/2014,"I was on my way to heaven when you died
I was racing up the express lane, I was cheating HOV lanes
Made it to the gate with record timing
I quickly threw my hazards on, no bother finding parking
I was on my way to heaven when you died
I was dressed in all black and I hoped
That nobody would notice me or the boltcutters I was hiding
Underneath my oversized jacket
I snuck around the back and broke you out when the gods weren't looking
I was on my way to heaven when you died
But then it was all over
They got us surrounded
They beat us with batons
Cuffed us and threw us in the car
When I wake up I want to talk to a lawyer
I demand a fair and speedy trial
Where do people go when they die?
How do you keep them alive?
How do you make sure that something like this won't ever happen again?
Where do people go when they die?
How do you keep them alive?
How do you make sure that something like this won't ever happen again?
Not to any other friends
But oh, how can a perfect human run out of luck
When there's just so many other people screaming ""jackpot!""
And oh, I cannot help but fear the things that I can't control
The things I'll never ever know
Where do people go when they die?
How do you keep them alive?
How do you make sure that something like this won't ever happen again?

She's always on my mind
She is a rose and I am a stone
She's always poking her head out
And striking a pose
I'm always plucking her petals
And some nights we fall out of love
Some nights I sleep in her arms
Some nights I sleep
Some nights I sleep on the couch

Well I spent that night in our past life
Wringing out the years from our shoes
In the distance you lived with my signature
Penned on a treaty that kept our armies at rest
But I was a pushy little one
When you tried to find someone new
I just kind of waited around for you
Because what else was I suppose to
What else was I supposed to do?

I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists

I saw it in your face the day we parked your car
On the shoulder by the reservoir
And in my mouth, my words did hide
For fear of being recognized

I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists"

With daddy issues
Who blames his broken home
I never needed you
I made it this far
I was happy on my own
I never asked for your help
Thought I could handle this myself
But you poisoned me to think
That I was nothing without you
You lied to me
I took the blame
Drinking soon became a part of me
A kid, who thought he threw his life away
You moved out
'Cause I had problems that you couldn't change
But now you say I'm not the fucking same I used to be
I don't need fixing
When I don't fit
Into the shape you moulded
You tell your friends
My case is hopeless

And I've got
Nothing left to give
I woke up in the street
To rain on my face
The taste of cigarettes
Bottle in hand
And disappointed friends
I can make it out if I could just clear my fucking head
But I've failed so many times
Cut so many teeth
I watched your tail lights fade
Over this stale town
Your arm still waving from the window
I can barely make out
I still can't believe
My life came down to this
But it's an eye for an eye
And I've got
Nothing left to give
And you're waiting for your friends to call

Too many times you've said and never done
And now it seems impossible to spark interest

That I still meant something
That I still meant anything

That I still meant something
That I still meant anything

These days
Busy friends
And late trains
A mattress on the floor
In a city that's been good to me
All this distraction from my old life
It haunts my decisions and plagues my mind
'Cause after all
I'm just a kid
Who's aspiration's were never more than dreams
But they still remain
I'm not going anywhere
(Anywhere)
I've fought so hard just to stand here
Overwhelming silence
(Silence)
I found where I belong
I needed this
And as smoke leaves my lungs
From my last cigarette
I'll fight my last fight
In a desperate attempt
To prove that I'm worth it
Worth your attention
Portrayed my rendition
Of a broken boy
I'm so tired of hiding
Behind my pen
It only goes to paper
What comes off my chest
But I can't forget
I've struggled to find a place that I could stay
Because settling has never been an option for me
I'd trade it in to never feel afraid
But everything goes away

I'm not going anywhere
(Anywhere)
I've fought so hard just to stand here
Overwhelming silence
(Silence)
I found where I belong
I needed this
According to me
I'm my own worst enemy
I can't keep a simple promise
Or even swear on anything
The bottle attached to my hand
Proves addiction makes
For a lesser man
And I can't muster up
The motivation
To break away
From this fucking pattern

I'm not going anywhere
(Anywhere)
I've fought so hard just to stand here
Overwhelming silence
(Silence)
I found where I belong

A better man makes my life easy
I've learned my lesson
Apply my passion
And give my heart to those that matter
I've finally made room to grow
But I still walk in these shoes I can't fill
I've come a long way since that day
Since you told me to be still
Acknowledge my surroundings
I never asked to be brought into this
And have no say in how it all ends
But what I know of the time I've been given
I owe to you and all your guidance
I've finally made room to grow
Have faith in me
I was just a boy
Tell me I've grown into the man
You inspired me to be

I swore I'd find myself

Medical shows

If I'd had listened
I would've known

Always smelt like grease

There lied my innocence
It was taken from me
The day the needle met your arm
You swore to me
I wouldn't see you die
Saving my meals
To make sure you eat at night
I'll wait for you to call and say
Things were just as fucked as I remembered
But it wasn't up to us to change
If someone could have listened
Maybe we'd have crossed their minds
And I could un-see everything and feel responsible for
My own life
No, you checked out
Told yourself it's not your fault
Running from the ghost of the days
That you left us with
And lately
I guess that's fine
No one we knew took their lives
Revenge is fucking tasteless
But an eye will always cost an eye
I'm taking responsibility
For everything that I did
'Cause no one made me do that shit
The hard part is coming to terms

Felt somebody looking at me

Dragged me out the bar to the back seat of her car

When the lights go out
She's all I ever think about
The picture burning in my brain
Kissing in the rain
I can't forget
My English love affair
Today
I'm seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head
Of a king size bed
Means I can't forget
My English love affair
My English love affair

Next thing we were back at her place
A hideaway in Mayfair, all the great and good there
Drinking all the way to third base
Princes getting naked, falling on their faces

The story line was so ridiculous
Every single step had me begging for the next
Before I knew it, it was serious
Dragged me up the stairs and it wasn't ending there

Like every single wish, we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all"
Joyce Manor,Christmas Card,Never Hungover Again,07/18/2014,"Looking at your face in the dark
You don't even look that smart
Could never make it past that part
And now I guess we never will
Looking for the keys to the truck
Your body's saying isn't that enough?
Your brain is going I don't give a fuck
You treat it like a game of skill
But it's more like a work of art
Or money in a Christmas card
You think about it way too hard
I'm gonna stay with you until
You disappear into the crowd
I don't know what you tried to tell me
You know I think about it still
Looking at your face in the dark
You don't even look that smart
I don't know what you tried to tell me
Disappear into the clouds
I don't know what you tried to tell me
You know I think about it still"

You could teach the seventh grade
Do you think because you chose to?
You always
Fell in love the way you're supposed to
At the Target inside of the mall
Fear of what you weren't exposed to
There's no way to keep in touch with certain people
You wonder how long something can last
Pretty sure most people don't think about that
But who the fuck is laughing now?
Sunken city by the ocean
Car smells like hot Gatorade
Do you think because you chose to?
Do you think things are different than you think they are?
Never really had a drug phase
So you think you're fucking miserable now?
For the Catalina fight song
You, always"

It's too sad
Blue marker on a paper bag
You could wear it like a mask
You could be your own dad
Like you're supposed to
I could show you
At the end of the summer
I start to feel it fade away
There's nothing I can do
At the end of the summer

Over the back wall and scraped my arm
It bled a little, but I'm fine

Washed the blood off of my arm

Never feel entitled

I can catch up on my sleep when I die

Anxiety is a crippler, nothing meaner than loaded eyes
Followed by a smirk and a whisper
As I pass you by, but I'll let it fly

Made a pledge to never grow up a bitter dinosaur
Never make mistakes that I made before
Never feel entitled

Thought it would be so sweet
You got all you dreamed but still feel incomplete
No, I'm not gonna settle anymore
No, I'm not gonna hold my tongue
If you haven't made enemies
Then you've never stood for anything
You're just dust in the breeze

Yellowcard,Lift a Sail,Lift a Sail,10/07/2014,"If a cold wind starts to rise
I am ready now, I am ready now
With the last sail lifted high
I am ready now, I am ready now

All the wreckage I left behind
I burned the earth beneath my weary weakened feet
Feel my heart stop and lift my eyes
I can't choose when to love
Or who I am part of


I was so wrong and unaware
I locked myself away
I thought that I'd be safe
Then I realized I'd gone nowhere
And life is just too sweet to lie in this defeat


If a storm blows in on me
I am ready now, I am ready now
When the waves come from underneath
I am ready now, I am ready"

Written for my heart
From my fingers fall
With you gone I break
Drifting off in space
Can you hear me call?
 
I need you
Need you
I need you

As all these mornings turn
Into brand new days
Everything still hurts
You're so far away
I would dig a hole
Through the Earth and crawl
To get to you

Wicked dreams they come
When I sleep alone
So I stay awake
Thinking ""No-oh-oh""
How I miss her so
How long must I await?

When you hate me, it makes me stronger
 
One more round
Kick me when I'm down
But I already won
When my name rolled off your tongue
You're a kid from the future, you're passive, and you're afraid

So when I hear your thoughts on me, I'm going to personally say

If you don't want me anymore

I did my best now I must survive and keep
Pushing on
I had a daughter as tall as I am
In my sleep I see the craziest things
Over her shoulder I saw you smiling
Now I don't want to wake up and it fades

When I'd swim in the ocean
I'd miss your skin
So fair the summer would burn it
When I'd hike up a mountain
I'd miss your smile
You'd love the view from the top of it
I would be reminded every day
I would be reminded every day of my shame

Criticized my mistakes

You never cared about them

So long, so long
And thanks for nothing
I'm gone, I'm moving on
Watch my resurrection
Watch my resurrection
The knife you stuck in my back
It couldn't cut through my spine

The ones you loved
You hid your life away
You didn't want them to know
You were hooking up with girls in Boston

You might be the worst person
I've ever met, I've ever known
You keep doing all that shit that
You regret
End up alone
You'd look in my eyes
Tell a lie and not even flinch
You would only stand close to me
To steal a dollar from my back pocket
Manipulate situations and weak minds
To feed all your desires
You would ruin relationships
Then post a smile and hope
Someone likes it
Oh, you know better
 
Will you ever get your head straight
Making excuses?
Better point the finger back at you
By now, you know there's no use in
Trying to fool me
'Cause I know the full story
So you seek out the meek
Kissing your feet
Spineless believers
Threw me down in the dirt
Dust off my shirt

Couples on their backs in the park
Lay on blankets bought
On a date the day before
A routine I've been longing for
Can't help but to glance
From the corner of my resentful eyes
Guess it's all perspective but
It's you I never get enough
We're always far apart

We've got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love
We've got a vicious love

When I go out alone
And see them sharing meals
Like Lady and the Tramp
Hate their loving eyes
Wishing it was you and I
Add tip to my receipt
Fold it up behind a picture of us
Guess it's all perspective but
Together though we rarely touch
Hard not to fall apart

We've got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love
We've got a vicious love

I could have given up a thousand times
In the past that was so easy
When the thought came to my mind
There was no convincing me
Plant my feet to face it all
Side by side or a phone call
Living in tension with you
Still feels better
Better than I've ever known

We've got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love

They're not as they appear
Appearances are made on Saturdays
Lessons come from gunfights, late nights, and courtesies
Anyone can define where you are
Choking on elixirs, mixers, and caviar
But I'm not getting through to you in a song

But I'm not getting through to you in a song
On your way up the hill

Superstitions we subscribe
Bat habits in denial
Good times

Lagwagon,In Your Wake,Hang,10/27/2014,"We all have an inherent body-count accountability
Hanging from the gallows in your mind
Side by side with sympathy
Way back, deep in your subconscious
Hibernating in guilt
Laden realizations of all that we have killed
And we say 'good riddance to their kind'
Committed to the crime
The bees are unimpressed
It's all lost in your wake
We are all flattering abuse, fighting sociopaths
Ideological childhood peers, our indoctrinated graph
We need to feel for others, we have to care to survive
So afraid to feel any pain, disconnected from my hive
We say 'good riddance to their kind'
Committed to the crime
The bees are not impressed
It's all lost in your wake
And it only hurts
When your heart beats
Or you're hanging on to loss
But it's far too strong
Everyone that's gone...
At last, it's all repressed
Inside your head
You're next to hang
The next to hang"

But somewhere in each day I recall
That crooked smile
Last few years to calculate
All the ways I could have changed your fate
And my role forever know the toll of stand by
One more song
One more visit to the cell where I belong
A hundred stories hanging on
Fifteen songs that hanging from each line
Goodnight
I recall the last song
And I can't handle Brooklyn anymore
But always long for one more sunrise
Knowing you are safe at home
I picture life but then the vision jumps away
Like the touch of death cursing my name
My cell, forever know the devil in details
A wrinkled page, scribbled word
A melody gone will never be heard
This one's writing itself
God help, what god?
One song, my aeroplane
Forever over the sea
Goodbye
I can't write this sad song long
And they won't share the first line anymore
But always long for one more song
Tony, we'll always long for one more song
Always long for one more"

Cradling our reason

Rising seas your willful God's damning lake of fire
And your certainty dismisses solution
The result of our behavior is the reason that you run

Hallowed be Thy Shame, Thy Name
March willingly...

Into wars
Won't be named, won't be framed, won't be strange
You and not just them will fight for land, hanging man
Will you still prey then?

I'm done arguing
Our fate is bound by innovation, not theory or fiction
That book you love but never read shouldn't leap into debate
Especially when your faith absolves you of empathy

Sanction appetite
Let the fuel run dry
It needs you to survive
Citizens too sensitive to face the urgency
They settle for fight, flight or freeze
Senses weary, hopeless meat, their children have to eat
The smallest monsters to defeat
Paralyzed by need

Are you numb below your nerve endings?
Trouser kneecap, broken hat
Dressed up in broken english
Poison in huge quill, poison in your quill
A founder of a scene
An uninformed machine
Love or hate everything
Somehow you see apathy as soul
A fool's youth's no excuse to be an asshole
It's speaking english but I don't understand it
Dancing on graves in their ancestors' gold
Sucking our air, dispel malignant revolt
Rats. What can I do?
My daughter has to live here too
Poison in the well
Poison in the well
A picture life in the outside lands
Somewhere far away from them

Not much has changed since

My friends will all move away
But I'll still call them when I can
Another day - another train
Another night inside my head
And not a minute passes by
That I don't think of what you said
Another friend another debt
I thought I'd already felt
Everything I'd ever get to feel
The memory numbs me still
And I can't go back there again
The tiny room upstairs
The year that time stood still
You weren't doing so well yourself back then
But you always had time for me
It rained nearly every day then
Desperate for a means to an end
Anything that we could manage
To make it stop
I thought I'd already felt
Everything I'd ever get to feel
The memory numbs me still
And I can't go back there again
The tiny room upstairs
The year that time stood still
Midday
At Flirtation hill
Sitting in your car
You asked me what was wrong
I said I'm tired of waking up
You sped at the fence
That bordered the edge
And when I begged you to stop
You looked at me and said
'Don't say it if you don't mean it.'
I thought I'd already felt
Everything I'd ever get to feel
The memory numbs me still
And I can't go back there again

I couldn't keep my fucking story straight
I pushed you all away

They still flicker

And you seemed better off
Since you moved away
I can't say I don't miss the company
Of such a better example
Of me
I know I had you all concerned
But I've changed now
I'm better
And I got just what I deserved
Persistence
Respect is a process
Torn between
Another bullshit apology
Or blaming everything I said
On a broken self-esteem
Dodge the burden
Evade the blame
Or suck it up and just come clean
It'll never be the same again
And all I have to thank is me
Is there anything I can say
To bring back the old days

I know I had you all concerned
But I've changed now
I'm better
And I got just what I deserved

Respect is a process

Though it's over it lingers
So tell the others when it works for you

Poor life choices
And lying through my teeth

Of my old bedroom

I'm obsessed with their stories
And memories

With the flakey white paint on the garage door
Trying to skate in the driveway
On a hand me down skateboard
I left my skin on the asphalt
The closest to pain that I'd felt
Too young to know what lonely was
Just you and three kids
In an empty fucking house
I never noticed, I never saw the pain
When fourteen years meant shit that day
It never mattered so much to me
It never changed a thing
The tests came in, you were sick
But its not like I didn't care
I just couldn't hear it
A wheelchair could never take my mum
If I just ignored it
You said we'd never have it differently
From the kids that were given everything
So instead I'd throw it in your face
The thought of letting someone in
Mum, now that I've been in love myself
I can't imagine how it felt
To be told that you could never love another man
Not like you had it easy
Not like you came out even
It's not like I could ask for any more
Than you'd already given
And it makes me sick
The bad luck had nothing to do with it
Just the heartless human beings
That you called your family
Apologise
You'll never get those years back
But you smiled through all of it
Apologise
You'll never get those years back
But you smiled through all of it
Now that I've been in love myself

Never love another man

All I ever had to do was call
But I've lost sleep over the
Thought of forgiveness"

Like putting wood in to the stove

On butchers paper on the kitchen table
I couldn't quite manage it back then
If only you could see now what I can do
Mum still has your old handbag
With all of your jewellery in it
I gave your pearl earrings
To the girl I love
On her 21st birthday
And all the car trips on rainy days
Trying to find where the rainbow begins
It's my warmest memory
When mum could no longer take care of you
We had to say our goodbyes at the nursing home
You didn't know why you can't come back with us
I've never seen my mother cry so much
And I watched grandpa visit you every day he could
He would stop by the bar on his way home
When the days weren't so good
Time alone so he wouldn't forget
What it was like when you remembered him
I didn't answer the phone
He walked home
And he died of a stroke
And mum gave you his wedding ring

She said you'd be so proud"

Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head

The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Is worth two lions but here I am
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams
But they're not quite what they seem

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part

You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide

I'm dying to live, something's gotta give

Maybe I'm a fucking waste

You and I were, you and I were fire
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fire

And I miss you in the June gloom too

You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks

May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

I'll be as honest as you'll let me
I miss your early morning company
If you get me
You are my favorite what if
You are my best I'll never know
And I'm starting to forget
Just what summer ever meant to you
What did it ever mean to you?

Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa

My 9 to 5 is cutting open old scars
Again and again till I'm stuck in your head
Had my doubts but I let them out
You are the drought
And I'm the holy water you have been without
And all my thoughts of you
They could heat or cool the room
And no, don't tell me you cried
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie

Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it

I wish I'd known how much you loved me
I wish I cared enough to know
I'm sorry every song's about you
The torture of small talk with someone you used to love

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks

Just like Judy
The kind that makes June feel like September
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent

She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, ""Baby, come home"" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Did you ever love her?
Do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing, ""Baby, come home""
""Baby, come home""

I've got those jet pack blues
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me
Honey, don't you leave
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink
It never mattered what it was, I think
Our hands were just that close
The sweetness never lasts, you know

She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, ""Baby, come home"" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Did you ever love her?

So put all of your anger on
In the truly gruesome do we trust
I will always land on you like a sucker punch

Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sang at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with Novocaine and now I'm just numb
Now I'm just numb
Don't mind me, I'm just the son of a gun
So don't stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I'm just numb
I don't feel a thing for you

I'm just a problem that doesn't want to be solved
So could you please hold your applause
Take this sideshow and all its freaks
And turn it into the silver screen dream

Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

Just to get me through the night till we're twins again
'Til we're stripped down to our skeletons again
'Til we're saints just swimming in our sins again
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on

I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Hit it, never quit it, I have been through the wreck
But I can string enough to show my face in the light again

There's a room in a hotel in New York City

Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores

A road that's quietly caving in
Come too far to pretend that we don't
We don't miss where we started
Looking back, I see a setting sun
And watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far, how we got this far
(how we got this far...)

They left us alone
The kids in the dark
To burn out forever
Or light up a spark
We come together
State of the art
We'll never surrender

""What a shame, what a shame!""
Beautiful scars on critical veins

A hill that's quietly crumbling
Been a while since you dressed for the kill
The kill that sent me tumbling
Looking up, I see a falling star
And watch its fire burn into the floor
And I am left standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard, why we fall so hard

And the pastor's words come pouring down like rain
How he called you a sinner and said now you walk with Jesus
So the drugs that took your life aren't gonna cause you any pain
I don't think he even knew your name
And I refuse to kneel and pray
I won't remember you that way
I lit you a candle in every cathedral across Europe
And I hope you know you're still my patron saint
I tried to forgive, but I can't forget the cigar in his fist
I know that they were heartsick, but I need someone to blame
And I know how they blamed me

Yeah, you were a storm that never rolled in
You were the northern lights in a southern town
A caustic fleeting thing
I'll bury your memories in the garden
And watch them grow with the flowers in spring
I'll keep you with me
These wolves in their suits and ties
Saying, ""Kid, you can trust me""
Charming southern drawl, sunken eyes
Buying good will in hotel lobbies
Buy fistfuls of pills to make sure you don't hurt no more
You don't gotta feel anything
Got their fangs in our veins
Got their voice in our head
Got our arms in their grips

And you rounded out my edges

I've got a scar across my forehead
Turning purple in the cold
From a night at Shore Memorial
I was sixteen and afraid
Turned away
Like I'm working babyface
Out of Mid-South in the eighties
I kept a blade hidden in my wrist tape

I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight 'til my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
I think enough is enough
Hidden in the tall grass
In the naked light of day
Put my past self in the ground
I've been dancing on the grave
I'm not the person that I was then
I'm tearing him away
I was bitter, I was careless
I was nineteen and afraid
But you deserve more from me
I don't know why I would say those things
But you deserve more than me
And I'm trying every day

I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
I think enough is enough

You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You were the baby teeth I buried
You were the sounds of distant cars
You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You were the banner that says ""no one""
That I tattooed across my heart
You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You scattered like ashes across every song that I write
You're where the light pollution starts

I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up

I'm laying on my back on the roof
Gonna shoot these clouds full of holes
I need some fucking light to pour through
Cause December's got me up against the ropes
And I don't know how to get loose
I can't get feeling back in my toes
From walking in circles with you
Like we're lost Canadian geese
I should be south of here already

I'll be your dead bird, you'll be my bloodhound
You're just doing what you're told
Pick my body off the ground
I'll be your dead bird...

I'm staring at Hemingway's shotgun
And I'll picture him drinking alone
He's forgetting things that he wouldn't have before
His eyes are starting to go
And I heard all about how his plane went down
After Christmas in the Congo
Read about his own death in the paper
I bet it was freeing to know
When you destroy everything worth chasing
There's no where left to go

I'll be your dead bird, you'll be my bloodhound
You're just doing what you're told
Pick my body off the ground
I'll be your dead bird
Hanging from your mouth
You're doing like you're told
Gonna make your master proud
It's good to know
I didn't die for nothing

December's got me backed into a corner again
My ears are back, my teeth are showing
I'm combing through the wreckage trying to find where I've been
I still get phantom pains but from a safer distance

I'll be your dead bird, you'll be my bloodhound
You're just doing what you're told
Pick my body off the ground
I'll be your dead bird
Hanging from your mouth
You're doing like you're told
Gonna make your master proud

The Wonder Years,A Song for Patsy Cline,No Closer to Heaven,09/04/2015,"My airbag light's been on for weeks
And I keep having dreams
Where I go through the windshield but I don't fix it
Patsy Cline came and sang to me
She told everybody
How she knew she would die soon before she did
I hear her cry on ""Faded Love""
The air in August here's heavy with salt and smoke and stings my lungs
My airbag light's been on for weeks
And I can feel it mock me
It's bittersweet like laughter through crooked teeth
I want to move so far from everything
That they could hear my heart beat
And then break as I lay dying in the street
They'll think the ice cracked at the lake
They'll think a tire blew out and a car crashed on the interstate

It's hard to watch you walk away
These aren't the vultures that were circling just yesterday
It's hard to watch you walk away
(It's hard to watch you walk away)
Picking at bones, at what's left of your misery
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
So when my vocal chords rip
So when my knees give in
So when I bury all of this
Who's gonna give a shit
If I'm breathing?

It's hard to watch you walk away
These aren't vultures that were circling just yesterday
It's hard to watch you walk away

On the glass was a better life

Staring at a hole in your chest
That's been dug there for decades
American broken promises
Caught between the lies you've been fed
And a war with your bloodstream

I was off on my own again
Selfish and stupid

So if you call me back or let me in
I swear I'll never let you down again
I know the devil you've been fighting with
I swear I'll never let you down again

I had that nightmare again
You're seven and helpless, angry as hell
And you balled up your fists but I laughed at your swings
And I beat you half-conscious

I want those years back

You did the same with your old army surplus blade
My blood's never as warm as I expect it
You grabbed my hand adorned in wildflower warpaint
You made yellows out of marigolds
You made purple out of camellias

We charged headfirst into the woods with bows and arrows drawn
Crudely fashioned-- sticks and rubber bands and spray paint
We swore ourselves protectors from all the evil in the world
You weren't born my brother, but you're gonna die that way

You ran alone (you ran alone)
In the falling snow
Barefoot down Whites Road
I watched your bruises grow (your bruises grow)
Strangely beautiful
Purple and yellow
You said don't
""Don't take me home
Don't take me home
Don't take me home""

Your father came in angry like a thunderstorm
Tossed you room from room and I watched color draining from your face
Fault lines started forming underneath all of your floorboards
We sat terrified waiting on an earthquake
I watched you put on a brave face
I wanted so badly to be brave

But you ran alone (you ran alone)
In the falling snow
Bare foot down Whites Road
I watched your bruises grow (your bruises grow)
Strangely beautiful
Purple and yellow
You said don't
""Don't take me home
Don't take me home
Don't take me home""

Kicked you out to teach you what a man is
But I don't think I'll ever know what that means
They'll put a gun into your hand and call you weak until you're violent
Don't believe it
They're hateful cause they're empty
We've got a chance to break the cycle

Of sunbleached and gray
Gonna sew them all together
Gonna fashion their bones into a frame
Tie the flags on a string
Stretched across until they're wings
I'm no closer to heaven
I clipped a bird with my car on the freeway
He won't see a burial
And all week long I kept thinking of death
How me and Hemingway share forehead scars
I won't meet the same fate that he did
In a world that I can't fix
With a hammer in my grip
I'm no closer to heaven
It feels like the day before something important
It feels like the first snow of the season that sticks
It's how I'll always feel like a failure
In the back of my head
No matter where I've been
The future feels bright
The glow of the city
Out across the great plains
With the closer I get
The further I feel away

Told me he fought in a war

I'm gonna clear my throat and speak out, unafraid

Faded light from the projector spitting summer out on the screen
The pool we swam in caved in years ago
We filled it up with furniture and concrete

The lines were simple and clean
And now the people I was taught would be heroes
Are acting like cowards, killers, and thieves

Stand up straight
I'm gonna clear my throat and speak out, unafraid
Dad, I want you to know
I'm letting everything you taught me guide me home"
The Wonder Years,Stained Glass Ceilings,No Closer to Heaven,09/04/2015,"Like a burning monk
You're my light flare out in the dark
You're my constant call to arms
Took the blindfold off
They'd left chalk outlines where the future was
It's a goddamn war of attrition
It's a death by a thousand cuts
And if these motherfuckers made it to heaven
They'd burn the bridge when they got across

They're gathering anchors
They're gathering rope
You're pushed into heaven all alone
They're grabbing your ankles
They won't let you go
The ebb and the distant flow
They're cutting your wings off
Built you ceilings out of stained glass

Well you're caught like gravel in my skinned knee
The wound will close eventually
You'll stay as a reminder of how fucked this world can be
Held your funeral on a Tuesday
Holy water's November-cold
That kid who pulled the trigger
Knew tomorrow couldn't promise him hope

All these bastards are gathering rope
You're pushed into heaven all alone
They're grabbing your ankles
They won't let you go
The ebb and the distant flow
They're cutting your wings off
Built your ceilings out of stained glass
They were cutting your wings off
I was staring at my idle hands
Maybe I could've done something
Maybe I could've made a difference

John Wayne with a God complex
Tells me to buy a gun
Like shooting a teenage kid is gonna solve any problems
Like it's an arms race
Like death don't mean nothing
To know the heavy price of living poor
Walled in by red lines, backed into a corner
Not knowing growing up what it's like to belong here in America

If everyone's built the same then how come building's so fucking hard for you?
It's something we're all born into
Nothing's left up to gray
It's black or white and sometimes black and blue
It's something we're all born into, whoa-oh
Now I know what's in a name
Not just my father
Three-fifths a man makes half of me
Why should I bother?
Merchants of misery stacking the deck
Fuck your John Waynes
Fuck your God complex
I have everything in front of me
But can't reach far enough
To touch those fever dreams
They call American
I am the ghetto's chosen one
The privileged bastard son

They're gathering anchors
They're gathering rope
You're pushed into heaven all alone
They're gathering anchors
They're gathering rope
You push into heaven all alone
No, all alone"

In the ocean, I let salt water rinse the dirt away
I stood calm in a room I hadn't been in
In a decade, I felt dizzy, used to stand here every day

Wait out the storm in a harbor town
Pretend I'll see you in Fall
Wait out the storm in a harbor town

Hey Hannah, don't go
We could've given you such a beautiful home
I won't call
Know you're waiting right outside
Thanks for the ride
I watched lines of container ships drift in
Just off of Long Beach, I thought long about where you would be today
We'd lose touch after college came and went
I'd hear you got married to some boy from California
Have a baby on the way

Wait out the storm in a harbor town

Out just north of Wings Field
Waiting on the runway lights
We were wrapped in winter coats
And I said I'd drive you home
You'd been pulling out your flask all night
I wrapped my arms around the moment like I'm clutching a memory
You alive in your madness, in love with the night
The glow of the furnace, the ambulance lights
The bluest things on Earth don't know shit about the blues
You used to be vibrant
You used to burn bright

Put out the light
In your clouded eyes
Kept you inside
Through the summer time
You put up a fight, pressing flowers at night
In a book that you love
The pieces they can't take of us
I found you shaking at the lake
A hospital bracelet still tight to your wrist
We talked to fill the empty space
Danced on the ice until it breaks
They flooded a town so this park could exist
You see us walking on the streets in your dreams
The pills that they fed you
Your half awake eyes
The bluest things on Earth don't know shit about the blues
You used to burn...

Put out the light
In your clouded eyes
Kept you inside
Through the summer time
You put up a fight, pressing flowers at night
In a book that you love
The pieces they can't take of us

Put out the light

Hit from behind with light
You're a painting of a saint
And I'm nervous, stumbling over my lines
When I tell you I love you
And we stare at Catalina
A city lost to the sea
Carried out by the tides
You were the one thing I got right
Goddamn, you look holy bathed in the January light
On the floor of our new bedroom
On the carpet with the window open wide
When you tell me you love me
I can actually see it
Your breath frozen in the air
Newborn droplets of ice
You were the one thing I got right

I'm measuring heartbeats in miles away
You held me together
I used to burst and decay
We got off the airplane
A couple of runaways
I was hoping you'd stay
Could you stay?
You were the obvious one
(From a taxi cab in Chelsea
Out past Salvation Mountain)
You were the obvious one
(From a walk along the highline
Out to Wicker Park in August)
You were the obvious one
(From your Upper East Side dorm room
To the South West Marin Headlands
With you smiling in the sand
Goddamn, I hate leaving)
Another early flight
I ran the dishwasher this morning
I wanted there to be clean plates for you tonight
I've grown used to your perfume
It hangs in the morning light
Wake me up before you leave for work
Kiss me goodbye

I'm measuring heartbeats in miles away

Running on the spot

Looking for signs
Not asking for help

Made it clear she's still here, are you listening now?
Just a ghost in the halls
Feeling empty, they're vacant now

Led to complications

Nothing left but picture frames

How'd we drift so far away
From where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway
Heartbreak that I can't escape
A sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway

All your screaming whispers
Slip right through my fingers
But these memories linger on
Eyes closed, all I see is
Good times disappearing
And I'm trying to hold on

I will fight to fix up and get things right
I can't change the world but maybe I'll change your mind

I'm a fool in a one man show
I'm a broken stereo, out of time
So how does it feel?
All alone, is it so surreal?

We're still first in line for
The front row of last resorts
One last ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on

I got a long term plan with short term fixes
And a wasted heart that just eclipses
And I push my luck from trust to dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart, put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
Could be the story of another us"

Faded, I'm wrapped in your arms
While you're waiting to tear me apart

You, you're a catch 22

I'm trapped under your spell
It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you
You're a catch 22
You're a catch 22

Restless, I stay awake with the spaces
The thought of our hands interlacing, it's taking over me
Reckless, I'm at your front door and I'm helpless
I'm twisted back up in the madness, repeating history
Promise me, you'll never let me leave

You, you're a catch 22
Win or lose, I'm screwed
I'm trapped under your spell
It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you
You're a catch 22

Let me go, I'm better off alone and here we go again

Simple Plan,P.S. I Hate You,Taking One for the Team,02/19/2016,"Dear Sophia
I think I'm better off without you

Like a Polaroid picture
I can still see you in mind
In your Def Leppard t-shirt
I said I was yours
You said you were mine
We started a fire
A fire like no one's ever seen before
There was something about you
There was something about you

But then you beat my heart up
Left it black and blue
Now I wish I never met you

Dear Sophia
I think I'm better off without you
I kinda miss ya
And making out all night like we used to
We were good together
But now the things you've done we can't undo
So don't write me back
P.S. I hate you

You can spare me the fake tears
We don't even need one last goodbye
I'll see you in ten years
Or maybe we should make that forty-five
We're done and it's over
And now the fairytale is up in flames
I hope it was worth it
Yeah, I hope he was worth it

And if there's one thing in this life I know is true
It's that I wish I never met you

Dear Sophia
I think I'm better off without you
I kinda miss ya
And making out all night like we used to
We were good together
But now the things you've done we can't undo
So don't write me back
P.S. I hate you

I hope one day you fall in love with someone new
And just when you think it's true
He breaks your heart in two
Just like you did to me
Just like you did to me

Dear Sophia
I think I'm better off without you
I kinda miss ya
And making out all night like we used to
We were good together
But now the things you've done we can't undo

I had a nightmare, but I wasn't dreaming
I ran outside to see it's not 2003
Turned on the radio, it's so confusing
Rappers were singing and Rockers DJ'ing
There's no guitars on the songs that they're playing
I called my shrink to see if I was healthy
I called my mom and she was taking selfies

Now all the punk rockers are over 40
They're coaching little league and reading stories
When did the neighborhood ever sound so good?
Looked on the corner and there's no more junkies
More girls and more grunge and bottles and more fun
Needles and squatters pissed off at their fathers
I can't believe it, man, it's all so boring
Went down to Gilman, yeah, the cops were snoring

Rescuing a nightmare from a dream

That none of this means anything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I... I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I... I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast

Back on earth I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast

I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
I said I'm sorry I'm a bit of a let down
But all my friends are daring me to come over
So I come over and over and over
So let me buy you a drink
And we'll pretend that you think
That I'm the man of your dreams
Come to life in a dive bar
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over

No more love, no more resolution
It's getting harder bearing the darkness within
I gotta let it out
I'm gonna let it

I can feel your bad vibrations
All around me
All consuming
Corrupting all that I am
This pain is a sickness looming over me, and I can't escape it
Casting shadows that continue to shape who I am on any given day

It's like a fog surrounds me applying pressure within
Weighing me down, seeing in double vision
It hits so hard I stu- stu- stutter my speech
Ya go kinda cold inside
Dancing on thin ice

I can feel your bad vibrations
All around me
All consuming
Corrupting all that I am
This pain is a sickness looming over me, and I can't escape it
Casting shadows that continue to shape who I am on any given day
This pain is a sickness looming over me, and I can't escape it

Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to

There goes the sunrise
Heart is broken, love unspoken
Here comes the moonlight

Listen to the sound of the voices south of Fifth

Hey Los Angeles when will you save me?
Los Angeles when will you save me?
Los Angeles when will you save me?
Los Angeles I'm never coming home (I'm never coming home, I'm never coming)

Come down (Come down)
I've been awake for days
Knocked out (Knocked out, knocked out)
By the sound of falling rain
Come down yeah, we'll watch the sun just burn away the sky
Watch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive

Los Angeles when will you save me?
Los Angeles when will you save me?
Los Angeles when will you save me?
Los Angeles I'm never coming home

Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends

Blink-182,Rabbit Hole,California,07/01/2016,"Dear head, shut up
I can't listen no more
It's late, so shut up
Is one night too much to ask for?

You are a haunted house
You're superstitious
You are the coldest stone carved marble faces

I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole

With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again

This bed, on fire
I can't sleep here no more
Too late and tired
Dreaming down on the floor

I am a haunted house
I'm superstitious
I am a cardboard cutout, old and faded

I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole

With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again

I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I won't fall down, I won't fall down
I'm barely standing on the ground
Barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole"
Blink-182,San Diego,California,07/01/2016,"Sometimes I wonder where our lives go
And question who we used to be
Sometimes I feel like I'm the oxygen between
The cigarette and gasoline

I can't sleep cause what if I dream
Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego
To San Diego
Can't go back to San Diego
Can't go back to San Diego

Abandoned Houses with the lights on
Late at night I call your name
Abandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors
I read the sadness on your face

I can't sleep cause what if I dream
Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego
To San Diego
Can't go back to San Diego
Can't go back to San Diego

I never needed to hear
All of the pain and the fear
Your secrets filled up my ears
Like the ocean blue
I never wanted to know
How deep these cuts on you go
And like a river they flow to the ocean blue

Going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego
San Diego
To San Diego
Can't go back to San Diego
San Diego
Can't go back to San Diego"

But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

I woke up in the pouring rain
West side Humboldt 7am
Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
With the radio on and a new black eye
Because I bet you couldn't knock me out
And I guess you really got me now
Black Sedan ran a red light
Just a drunken bike messenger on Tuesday night

I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober
When I'm sober
When I'm sober

She undressed and we stumbled downstairs
Fell on to the table as the neighbors just stared
We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
Digging with our hands in the dirt outside
And she dragged me to the edge of town
And she slapped me, then she pulled me down
I can do bad and you can do better
Spending all night getting lost together

I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

Sober

My life was leading me to you
I was in the outfield too

I was thinking about school, it was so fucking painful
My parents were both such a wreck
I needed to lean on a friend
And you were stuck out there, somewhere in California
And I was daydreaming about falling asleep next to...

We could leave, just forget it all and live forever
Run away, run away
We can go, we can drive to somewhere new

Will you stay? Come on, tell me that we'll live forever

Ride this highway 'til we raise the bar
Desert and mountains and the moon rise
Alive and so lonely on this road we drive

Poets and slaves have taken this ride
Battling demons within and outside
Clues in a mystery on an unknown road
Together we lighten the world and its load

Turn on the headlights, I think it's time
We're all looking for something

Driving all day, driving all night
Driving all day, it's alright
Driving all day, driving all night
Driving all day, driving all night

We feel so close and so far away
To something we've lost never knew went away
There's no need to speed, direction is right
Some place but some how no place tonight

Turn on the headlights, I think it's time
We're all looking for something

Driving all day, driving all night
Driving all day, it's alright
Driving all day, driving all night
Driving all day, driving all night"

Water ran from my body
Crystal clear, chlorinated and sky blue
As the icy cold brought life back to my feet
Every breath in was something I owed you

I heard they cut you down in your own bedroom
I wondered if you'd still remember

When we remember
We only get a version of the last time we remember it
And as time rolls on like it always does
Though it might be a little different, I won't forget
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing

Tell me why I didn't die in that swimming pool?
When you saved my life, did you know that, that would take your own?
Who decides if we stay or if we go?
Did it cross your mind that I'm alive because of you?

I heard they cut you down in your own bedroom
I wonder if you'd still remembered
You gave it all away for a girl
You didn't fix it, you just ended it
I heard they cut you down in your own bedroom
I wonder if you'd still remembered
You gave it all away for a girl
You didn't fix it, you just ended it
When we remember
We only get a version of
The last time we remember it
And as time rolls on like it always does
Though it might be a little different
I won't forget
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing

Just two kids
When you pulled me out
We never really spoke
But I still saw you around
Friends of friends
What does that mean to you now
I heard everybody came
When they put you in the ground"
Joyce Manor,Fake I.D.,Cody,08/08/2016,"Tell me what more could she want to be
A super hot friend with a fake I.D
She takes off her clothes and hands them to me
And what she did next I could not believe
Don't be fooled
The first two hours ruled
But then she seduced
Herself out of her room
Singing, ""What do you think about Kanye West?""
""I think that he's great, I think he's the best""
""Yeah, I think he's better than John Steinbeck
I think he's better than Phil Hartman""
""Don't you agree?""
""Can't you see you're just like me
The man can do things
The rest of us can only dream of, baby""
Tell me what more could you want to see
Try to calm down or leave it to me
Freight elevator, now we're really rocking
Breaking my heart going window shopping
Don't be shy
Cause my friend Brandon died
And I feel sad
I miss him, he was rad"

Scratched my balls and eyes
I looked into the mirror
And got a big surprise
I don't know who this person is
But I've seen his face before
A face I don't want to have to face
I don't think I like me anymore

When I run into old friends
Their eyes seem to dart away
I wish I could remember
All the shitty things I say
Then one day my best friend said something
I'd never heard before
You've done so much for me
And I love you
But I don't like you anymore

Someone lock the door
I don't like me anymore
And here comes media whore
I heard this story twice before
I don't like me anymore
Pop punks claiming hardcore
I don't like me anymore

Was it something that I've done?
Was it something that I've said?
Was I having too much fun?
Did I dropkick someone's head?
I turn on the TV
And I don't like what I see
There's an old punk rocker acting like a jerk
And that jerk looks a lot like me

Someone lock the door
I don't like me anymore
And here comes media whore
I heard this story twice before
I don't like me anymore
Pop punk claiming hardcore
I don't like me anymore

Catastrophe uncertain
Hit the lights and drop the curtain
Organize a mob and rush the door

Peel me off the floor
I don't like me anymore
A burning open sore
I don't like me anymore
People say they love me
Then ask for something more
The never-ending story
A filibustering bore
A pompous dinosaur
I don't like me anymore
Why does being nice to people
Feel like such a chore?
I'm paid to be your clown but
Feel like anybody's whore
A somber fact I wish I could ignore
I don't like me anymore"

But I didn't think it'd change a part of me
Can't get back to who I was back then (who I was back then)

Seems wrong to pretend

I need an answer, I've got the questions
Can't anyone out there just relate?
Turn off the radio

Someone out there, if you're listenin'
We're the victims of our indifference
Tell us more without controlling
What we think with what you're showing

Turn off the radio

Turn off the radio
To clear my mind and let me think

Joyce Manor,Last You Heard of Me,Cody,09/14/2016,"Found myself down at the Alibi
For the second time this year
Wrote my song down, gave it to the guy
Then went to grab another beer
Sonia's going to the parking lot
Probably gonna smoke some weed
I'd go with but I don't touch the stuff
Unless I wanna go to sleep
You step outside to have a cigarette
Smokers crowd into the street
Digging through your purse for matches
When for a second our eyes meet
And in the moment I see everything
Start to finish, sad defeat
Shivering, lying naked next to you
And that's the last you heard of me"
Green Day,Still Breathing,Revolution Radio,09/23/2016,"I'm like a child looking off in the horizon

I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine

Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away

I'm like a loser that's betting on his last dime

I'm like a son that was raised without a father
I'm like a mother barely keeping it together
Oh I'm still alive

Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away, away...

As I walked out on the ledge
Are you scared to death to live?
I've been running all my life
Just to find a home that's for the restless
And the truth that's in the message
Making my way away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses

A fleeting memory of where I want to be

Try to find some peace in falling out

But we can't get lost in time
I'll be yours and you'll be mine

You tell me there must be a little light left flickering
Burning in a place we set afire

We gotta swing away, gotta cut the wire

Running my whole life to reach this place
And just when I arrive, the moment fades out
Will you let me?

Stop time
Your hand in mine
Bring me closer as it all gets ripped away
And I say goodbye to the clearest eyes
I won't be with you
But I won't be far away

I don't need an answer
But if you rewrote the past
Do you think you'd just leave me out, leave me out?
Or will you spin your head around in every crowded room
To see if I can be found, be found?

Every single plan you will forget
So do what makes you happy
No regrets now
I won't let you

Stop time
Your hand in mine
Bring me closer as it all gets ripped away
And I say goodbye to the clearest eyes
I won't be with you

I remember when you asked me how far that I could throw this love I found
And then I heard you say you'd wait around
I won't let you

Stop time
Your hand in mine
Bring me closer as it all gets ripped away
And I say goodbye to the clearest eyes

And I'm still out here looking for answers
I've ended up wrong the faster I've gone
But I know I am finding the answers
Remembering every attempted flight
I don't want to stay here
I told myself I listened close I filled my ears
Long nights alone
No, you can't understand
You just want to transform
An empty stage, a fit of rage and you are born

Joyce Manor,Angel in the Snow,Cody,10/07/2016,"I want to go together
Together like a barking dog with you
Cause I stay home all day
Afraid to live my life
Maybe tomorrow
I'll want to do something else
Cause I'll be feeling better
Much better in a half-lit moon with you
I don't know what to say
To say to save my life
Waiting to follow
I can't control myself

Like old times fading away from me
Angel in the snow
How come nothing amazes me?
I don't know

I bet it's gone forever
Burned up in a fire ball
The glue
Has melted all away
The world just falls apart
Pain leads to sorrow
And sorrow leads me back to how

Like old times fading away from me
Angel in the snow
How come nothing amazes me?
I don't know

It must be something out of nothing
Makes you think you're really not good
Paid seven dollars
For a plastic cup of vodka
Doesn't make a difference
Doesn't make it wrong or right
You gotta stay this way forever
'Til it makes you want to die
You needed something out of nothing"
Joyce Manor,Do You Really Want to Not Get Better?,Cody,10/07/2016,"From the capital letter
Do you really want to not get better?
Could you see me in your life? Could you try?
Even after you've been gone
For an actual endless amount of time
Would you even know?
Could you see me in your life?
Could you see me in your life? Could you try?
From the capital letter
Do you really want to not get better?"
Joyce Manor,Eighteen,Cody,10/07/2016,"But doesn't it feel good
To take off your t-shirt
And let somebody feel ya
Somebody steal ya
You can't get behind what
You can't even find
It's getting harder to deal with
It's nothing to fear, easy for you to say
Say, doesn't it feel bad
Things that you can't have
Even when you were near her
Wearing a t-shirt
You can't be defined by
What you're keeping inside
Might push you into the lime-light
Just give it a try
Still don't believe in yourself
At eighteen
Life's a bad dream
Then you wake up
Things are different for you
It seems so simple
When you step out and view it
Just find something to do
And then do it
Everybody gets a little lonely sometimes
I get so tongue-tied
I feel so old today"
Joyce Manor,Make Me Dumb,Cody,10/07/2016,"No demand, no California
No one to find to find and bore you to tears
It took me years
No decay, no ""stay the same to some""
No ""I'll show you! Sure!"" you'll make me dumb
As dumb as a fucking piece of chalk

On the summer sidewalk
In the summer sun
When you were young
You make me dumb

Saw a man, I saw a mountain
Want you around, around the fountain for real
It's no big deal
How to change your name and still get paid
Just wait, it's great, you make me paint
My fucked up feelings for everyone

On the summer sidewalk
In summer sun
When you were young
You make me dumb


On the summer sidewalk
In summer sun
When you were young
You make me dumb
On the summer sidewalk
In summer sun
When you were young
You make me dumb

In summer sun
When you were young"
Joyce Manor,Over Before It Began,Cody,10/07/2016,"Over before it began
Some of them were friends, I guess
And others, I guess they were fans
Some of them were strangers
Some of them were part of the plan
They were all the same
They were over before
Before they began
Closer, as close as you can
Closer than the clothes you were wearing
Closer than we understand
Closer than a cousin
Closer than a woman and man
Closer than the closest thing
But still over before it began
Some of them were strangers
Some of them were part of the plan
They were all the same
They were over before
Before they began
Over before it began
Even though I have always loved you
It was over before it began
Even though I have always loved you
It was over before it began
Even though I have always loved you
It was over before it began"

That I could buy and sell me
There's no such thing as luck
Well, hey, OK
Then how do you explain
How things have changed so much
In the autumn leaves
High on LSD
Here comes the campus security
To take that away from me
Wanna see for myself
I wanna see what it means
But I can't because I'm stuck in a reversing machine
People used to tell me

Joyce Manor,Stairs,Cody,10/07/2016,"So you just stand there
With a dollar at your feet
And you wait as I retreat
To go get mine
And when I get back
You're still waiting silently
Cause my mother's fast asleep
Right next door
Yeah, I'm 26 and I still live with my parents
Oh, I can't do laundry
Christ, I can't do dishes
What'll I do without you
When your body fails you
When nobody loves you
All they do is miss you
But they don't even care
So be careful when you run downstairs
Be careful who you talk to
Or the wonderful way you walk
You are like a magnet for all evil
So you just stand there
With a dollar at your feet
And you wait as I retreat
To go get mine
And when I get back
You're too terrified to speak
And my brother's such a creep
Even more
Yeah, be careful when you run downstairs
Be careful who you talk to
Or the wonderful way you walk
You are like a magnet for all evil
Cause there's so much good inside you
And I wish that I could hide you
Some place no one could hurt you
Where nobody could change you
I'll lock you in my room
And I'll tie you to the sheets
Cause I could watch you sleep for weeks
Oh, the things you'd never see
If it were up to me
Oh, I can't do laundry
Christ, I can't do dishes
What'll I do without you

Joyce Manor,This Song is a Mess But So Am I,Cody,10/07/2016,"I wrote this one for you
Cause that's all I could do
Sad, but it's all true
So I guess it'll have to do
Entrust the broken wing
A bird that doesn't sing
Useless, not unused
Some other cover coming through
Just wanna sleep away the hour
Blinded by the light
This song is a mess but so am I
Beneath the soda stream
When you begin to dream
When you said, ""nothing's new""
Made fucking zero sense from you
Just wanna sleep away the hour
Blinded by the light
This song is a mess but so am I"
NOFX,Bye Bye Biopsy Girl,First Ditch Effort,10/07/2016,"It came back negative and gave us a scare
The next year it grew back again and you started to swear
And after chemotherapy, you threw up and lost all your hair
And when I said bye bye biopsy girl
You acted like I didn't care
I took you to the Mission, you could order pollo
I took you to Chinatown, you said, 'Let's take it to go'
But when I asked you to take it Greek and ATM with French
I had to say bye bye bilingual girl
You said no and knew the consequence
And when I called La Migra and the INS
They took away your documents
You took me to the Jamesons and said, 'Swingin' is fun'
You told me I was good in bed, but you wanted to be with more than one
And when you said your friend was hot and I could go all the way
I had to say bye bye bisexual girl
I didn't know your friend was gay
I had to say bye bye bisexual girl
When he said I had to pay"
NOFX,California Drought,First Ditch Effort,10/07/2016,"I once heard a song about it never rains in Southern California
I once saw a band play at the Farm sober I hadn't had a drink
Like cleaning gums or huggin' bums
Or doin' something that you know's good for ya
Those times are tedious and tenuous
And hopefully much shorter than a blink
I'm so easy to deciphe, I could rationalize for life
But from all the strife I caused, I gotta go without
Taking codones is insane, I don't wanna kill I want more pain
So like the California drought, I'm dryin' out
I got the one job that it's frowned upon if you're not a user
The bands that are all sober are the ones playing the Warped and county fairs
I'll go to an alcoholics meeting and get booed and called a loser
Then I get invited to a party from a bro who works at Bayer
He's got the shit from 1910, bottled H that's genuine
I just wanna see what all the hype's about
I just gotta try it once, but I say no cuz I got 3 months?
And like the California drought, I'm dryin' out
My sponsor should be Ernie Ball or PBR not Pat from Petaluma
The chips I want are kale, corn, potato, and for betting on a flush
But now I gotta listen to a 20 minute story that's just a rumor
And I'm sorry but this nicotine and caffeine don't gimme the same rush
I'm a jest pilot in jux, to positions in a crux
I'm not in fashion I'm in flux, so they all doubt
I just want some cocaine but it's making me insane
I think I may have broken my brain so I'm dryin' out"
NOFX,Dead Beat Mom,First Ditch Effort,10/07/2016,"She's a dead beat mom, a one woman pogrom
A tri-polar paradigm, a lunatika time bomb
When everything is alright, she makes everything wrong
Living only to spite and spit napalm, she's a dead beat mom
She's a dead beat mom, she's a dead beat mom
She's a dead beat mom, a storm without a calm
VPA and Lithium is what she should be on
An emotional vacuum, a good vibe tampon
She got her degree in poisonous pedagogy
A course taught by her mom
Someone stop her before she destroys
The childhoods of my two boys
My sons mean everything to me
So I pray for some agency to tell her that she's wrong
But the Dead Beat Mom isn't able to hack it
She needs to be in a Prada straight jacket
A padded rubber room is where she belong
It's a perfect place for, maybe add some mace for
The Dead Beat Mom, she's my Vietnam
I got PTSD and an STD
Is everything ok?
NO EVERYTHING IS WRONG
Last week I saw her humming this song
She's a dead beat mom, she's a dead beat mom
She's a dead beat mom, she's a dead beat mom"
NOFX,Ditch Effort,First Ditch Effort,10/07/2016,"Living for nothing does not require reason
Ban no ambition call it national treason
I've been outside the cave and told them 'bout the light
They told me they don't want to know about it
Fuck you and good night
We've got a sickness, it's not a moral judgment
It comes from thickness and 30 year begrudgement
You end up sighing it's only STD
We've all got sickness but I'm the one with Hepatitis C
I don't need doctors, I don't need treatment
Need to be treated like a man who's halfway decent
I told them that I think bad thoughts and I just might
They told me they don't want to hear about it
Fuck you and good night!"
NOFX,Generation Z,First Ditch Effort,10/07/2016,"I think that our kids will probably see the end of humanity
As we know it, cause this world's about to blow it
Will they see what they saw in ancient Rome
The destruction of the home?
Will they see the end of civility?
Cause when morality's been blurred, procreation seems absurd
And human rights and freedom are just words
That have lost all their meaning
In a world that is bleating like an animal at slaughter
I hope that my daughters never know what it feels like to give up
To know the whole world is corrupt
To realize that they are really on their own
And there's no one left who cares about the future
Infected cuts don't need a suture
There's a feeling that the human race has seen the checkered flag
And the laps that are given are the last ones ever driven
And everyone who's still living knows that
It's a shame that the Earth will live on but can't give birth
To a baby planet where we could start over again
We've been divided, we've been bled
Like a chicken without a head, running frantically amok
Taking but not giving a fuck
History is just an alibi
It's believing every lie man has ever dared to write
It's so much easier to see than complex reality
A lifetime full of misery and blight
So we tell our daughter's and sons that they're not the final ones
To see this planet as a decent place to live
We use a telescope to give them faith to give them hope
Anything to help them cope with their future
Cause there's no alternative
Kings and queens ruled the land
There's more and more lines drawn in the sand
Pawns are crooks castles are rooks
It's too bad the good books
Written for the sub-classes to introduce morality
Had nothing to do with reality
But then again who would have ever read them
We read the Par Quran for lunch
Eat Old Testaments for a snack
And read the Lulla-bible before bed
There's no more points of view
(It's sad I'm gonna see)
When your only thought is food
The bible has been replaced with a survival guide
(The end of history)
That uses perishables instead of parables
Because there's no stories left to preach
(We don't wanna be)
There's no large lessons left to teach anyone
Why bother?
(The Generation Z)
Who are we
Are we the intellects, or the insects?
(We don't wanna see)
We're not the ones who will ever know the answer
It's impossible for us to imagine what is right in front of us
(A species you and me)
I guess that's what makes us think we're human
But being human only lets us see a little farther than animals
(The end of history)
Feel depression from spending most of your life working?
(The Generation Z)
Try chemicals
Chemicals make everything better!
(The end of history)
Hate, love, morality
(The Generation Z)
They're just chemical reactions

Are we just chemically imbalanced ants
On chemically fueled rants?
It really just comes down to sex and power
I bet the last man standing
The last human on this planet
The last person on the earth
Doesn't give a shit
Or have any idea that he or most likely she
Is the last one
The last person on this planet will fuck the dead
And die thinking not about why didn't anyone care
But why her life was so unfair
It's time, it needs to be said
I'm sorry to be the one to inform you
But man and womankind has unfortunately been pronounced dead"

NOFX,I'm A Transvest-lite,First Ditch Effort,10/07/2016,"I first heard Frank say, he wanted to dress like Fay Wray
I wanted that too but what could I do in junior high school in L.A
My heart skipped in the scene, he said you gotta be it, not just dream
It was a taboo I knew I wouldn't pursue, I didn't have the self esteem
I gotta confess that I like to cross dress
And I've been doing it since I was 13
It's hard to tell bros that you wear women's clothes
Even in the 'open minded' punk scene
You'd probably get hurt in heels and a skirt
When you're in the middle of a circle pit
So I'd only wear panties under boxers to keep it all a secret
Now I'm telling everyone cuz it's fun and I don't give a shit
Forward 30 years, I still had the same fears
Then I saw Hedwig play a Bilgewaters gig
And I felt the same envy and tears
I decided right there, I can't be bothered to care
What other people think, I'm gonna dye my pubes pink
And throw out all my Hanes underwear
I'm not transgender, I'm a lazy crossdresser
Who thinks make up is too much of an ordeal
I paint my toes and wear shiny tight clothes
Not for the look but how it makes me feel
I don't need things just right, I'm a tranvest-lite
I only shave to do the Time Warp midnight Saturday
I'm done with self-pity, I don't have to feel shitty
Cuz I wanna look pretty so I give it the old city college try
Don't get me wrong, I still wanna be a guy
Who sometimes likes to dress like a girl
He sometimes likes to wear diamonds and pearls
Don't think I don't know I'm not foolin' anyone
He's a cross between Adele and Charlie Chaplin
You know it's not just girls who just wanna have fun!"
NOFX,I'm So Sorry Tony,First Ditch Effort,10/07/2016,"I've never known a better writer or a better guy
His songs wouldn't just touch you
They would punch you in the eye
It doesn't happen a lot when everybody has the same thought
'He wasn't supposed to die'
So let's CLANK our beers and give three cheers for Tony Sly
I never heard a bad word about him
I never heard a bad melody
His dying isn't tragic, it's a fucking catastrophe
I've lost my parents and so many friends I chalk it, c'est la vie
It's nothing like losing my friend Tony
Sometimes on weekends when our kids hang out together
Kiera tells Darla that her dad's songs are better
And I think she's sad, cuz tomorrow she hopes her dad
Will be coming home, cuz he told her that 3 years ago on the phone
Tony, you make me see myself in a way I don't wanna see
Do I have to stop living so wrecklessly?
So I can be the father I know I can be
All the endless nights we had, the 20 years of laughs
I've looked but I can't find any photographs of us
Because it's weird to take photos with your best friends
Cuz you don't think that you'll never see them again
I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you
When you needed me in the end
I was there to give your eulogy
But not when you needed a friend
When they lowered your body into the ground
Even the piper began to cry
From coast to coast, let's raise our drinks and give a toast to Tony Sly"

It may be lonely at the top
But for those of us who couldn't stop
We've got a hundred dozen friends
Who make sure the party never ends
We're at a one way dead end cul-de-sac
I hit rock bottom but it didn't hit back
I gotta say this really ain't so bad
It's a funny thing, it's never lonely
I really can't complain cuz it feels like home to me
Tell me to quit and talking shit about
I really gotta say, this bottom ain't so bad
I got a demon juggernaut from battles I already fought
I put the cog in cognition, I'll sign my last resignation
There is a neon sign and a wooden plaque, they say:
You've hit the bottom, we knew you'd be back
I gotta say, it really ain't so bad
Tell me to quit, I'm sick of hearin' it
Don't see the benefit because it's really not so bad

With every Demeroltercation
They'll have a good Xanaxplanation

You gotta kill the groupie and frame the junkie
No one cares about Nancy Spungen
And Sid will be on Rikers in the dungeon
If you wanna be the first lady, you gotta get rid of Sid
And make it look like an OD
Hinckley didn't do it for Jodie Foster
He was a Pistols fan and a punk rocker
He wanted revenge on the First Lady

I'm high on cellular waves
I put the ""riot"" in patriot
And we all die in threes

I got a seat in the middle of the road
I'm gonna take my time
I shop online so I can vote
At the speed of life
I'm like a drone way up in the sky
I'm a shooting star
There's a soldier that's freaking out
P.S. this is war

All grown up and medicated
I'm high on cellular waves
I put the ""riot"" in patriot
And we all die in threes
All we want is money and guns
A new catastrophe
Here goes nothing, there's nothing to lose
It's a small price we pay
When we all die in threes

Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now

Hallelujah! I found my soul
Under the sofa pillows
Congratulations, I found myself
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now"
Green Day,Too Dumb to Die,Revolution Radio,10/07/2016,"Oh, oh I love you
Oh, oh I do
I got a sentimental illness for you
Please don't go away, oh yeah

I was a high school atom bomb
Going off on the weekends
Smoking dope and mowing lawns
And I hated all the new trends

Me and my friends sang:
""Woah! Here's to the middle of the road!
At least it's better than here""

Looking for a cause
But all I got was Santa Claus
I'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high, too scared to dream
But too dumb to die

My daddy always was on strike
Going off with the Teamsters
He said that ""Everything will be alright...
Not every Sunday can be Easter""

The picket line screamed:
""Woah! Don't cross
Don't cross the line because you'll be a scab, not a martyr!""

Looking for a cause
But all I got was camouflage
I'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
Too scared to dream
But too dumb to... uhm... yeah..
Hey!

Looking for a cause
But all I got was camouflage

Green Day,Troubled Times,Revolution Radio,10/07/2016,"What good is love and peace on earth
When it's exclusive?
Where's the truth in the written word
If no one reads it?
A new day dawning
Comes without warning
So don't think twice

We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times

What part of history we've learned
When it's repeated?
Some things we'll never overcome
If we don't seek it
The world stops turning
Paradise burning
So don't think twice

We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times

We run for cover
Like a skyscraper's falling down
And then I wonder
Like a troubled mind

What good is love and peace on earth

Where's the truth in the written word
If no one reads it?

To comprehend the time between asleep and awake
And read it on our graves

Of the limits we've made
If love is just a chemical reaction
Why is death so different?"

Find somewhere new to go
Make new friends who don't know anything about you
It all starts making sense when you never found what you were looking for
It's not a place but a person who feels like home
Packed my life into a single cardboard box

A hand in my head and I came undone
I guess it's kinda nice to know that nothing will change when I'm gone
I'll stay numb until my day in the sun

Got no time for anyone
Call, call your son
And break your heart with the message tone

A hungry aching void
That clamoured to be filled
And only found easement in your voice

I'll keep the world awake
For taking me away
As long as there's breath left in me
None shall sleep
Stay
I'll be your favourite mistake

I can feel it burning in my skin

To say how you make me feel

I'll be your favourite mistake"

It bounced and retained it's shape
Would my body do the same?
Please just drive this car into a wall
Anything to break the silence
We could die on impact
Or we could just drive straight through

Pick your bones up off the street
Take the car back before someone knows it's missing
Burn it out on the side of the road
We know that's what you're good at
Make your annual escape from home
Before they know what hit them

Walk on your friends to fly
We've run out of reasons for watching you die

We were just children
When I held your hand
I promised if you go then I go the same
What a stupid way to see
If your friends can keep their promises
Aren't you tired of hospital beds?

I know the feeling man
You can't count the fuck ups on two hands

Like running water
What are you running from?

If your friends can keep their promises

If you go
I go

Chasing a kid with his orange soda mustache
While his father's by the gambling wheel
There I saw you in the beer tent
Hanging with your new husband and your baby on the way
Oh it's kind of strange how it made me miss something
Long lost in the both of us now

I pulled against the tide
A solitary Mind
There was a big bright moon
I was out of tune and time
Panic on the radio
Running with nowhere to go
You can't think in a language you don't know
So keep breathing
Stood up in the light
A fucking animal inside
I've never been the kind of loon that tries to hide
All the ways we try to shrink away from all the shit that stinks
And I can't think
And I thought you were my friend
(I'm shuttin' up again)

Watch what you say
So you don't say nothin'
Choking on your words like the cops are coming
And you feel so small
Like nothing at all
And since the last time saw me fall
I don't say anything at all
I don't say anything at all
No, not at all
But I say

Keep breathing
Keep breathing
Keep breathing
Covered in the dirt and fear
Let the waves wash away all the skin off this year

Watch what you say
So you don't say nothin'
Choking on your words like the cops are coming
And you feel so small
Like nothing at all
And since the last time saw me fall
I don't say anything at all
I don't say anything at all
No, not at all
But I say

Keep breathing
Keep breathing
Keep breathing"
The Menzingers,After the Party,After the Party,01/09/2017,"It's the little things my mind commits
To etch behind my eyelids
Like getting stoned when we wake up
Coffee grounds and coffee cups
Your silhouette in high top sneakers
And hardcore from laptop speakers
The classics to the more obscure
From Minor Threat to your old roommate's band

Like a kaleidoscope in vibrant hues
I navigate around your tattoos
Said you got that one on a whim
When you were breaking up with him
And that Matryoshka Russian doll
That lines your shelf from big to small
What a way to start anew
To shed your skin and find the old you

Everybody wants to get famous
But you just want to dance in a basement
You don't care if anyone is watching
Just as long as you stay in motion
We put miles on these old jean jackets
Got caught up in the drunk conversations
But after the party, it's me and you
After the party, it's me and you

With a new outlook on everything we see
From high upon this rooftop over South Philly
To the nights we lose our self-control
From the sex, from the drugs, from the rock and roll

Everybody wants to get famous
But you just want to dance in a basement
You don't care if anyone is watching
Just as long as you stay in motion
We put miles on these old jean jackets
Got caught up in the drunk conversations
But after the party, it's me and you
After the party, it's me and you
After the party, it's me and you
After the party, it's me and you"

Aurelia, they brought you new chains
They're barking in the wrong key
They're barking in the wrong key
They're barking in the wrong key
And you sing along
Aurelia, dream animals' wills
Are real enough to make the slow kill
They're barking in the wrong key
They're barking in the wrong key
They're barking in the wrong key
And you sing along
Can you see at night?
We can see at night

AFI,Dark Snow,AFI (The Blood Album),01/20/2017,"I wanted to take you
From those robes to feel the cold
Undressing the blessings
Feels like my afterlife, my afterlife
I go on
Yet on that night I went down with the lights, somehow
Over and over I go on
They carried me out when the lights went out
Over, I'm over
I wanted to keep you
But I was told you'd grown too old
For someone who stayed young by bleeding light
My afterlife... is black and cold
I go on
Yet on that night I went down with the lights somehow
Over and over I go on
They carried me out when the lights went out
Over, I'm over
I go on
Yet on that night I went down with the lights somehow
Over and over I go on

AFI,Feed From The Floor,AFI (The Blood Album),01/20/2017,"Dust on dust, in a new room
First impressions of the sun
Burnt the skin now are buried
We've been staring up too long
Eyes gone dry. No more tears
Salt and shame upon my tongue
Dust on dust, drying flowers
We've been coming here too long

Here in the golden mirror
Watch every word you say
Shatter and find a way
To cut like golden days

Flesh on flesh on the dry earth
Our reflections are the same -
Wearing dust, match the desert
Past is captured as it's made
In your image, like an actress
Lying to protect her age
Dust on lens. Dying flowers
We shall not return again

Here in the golden mirror
Watch every word you say
Shatter and find a way
To cut like golden days

You're watching as I fade
Fading as I'm watching every word I say
Loving how I fade, fading like a flower
Knowing that the rain...

That the rain may fall too late
It can't revive my dying flowers
Oh the rain may fall'
Too late. This is our final hour

Here in the golden mirror
Watch every word you say
Shatter and find a way
To cut like golden days

You're watching as I fade
Fading as I'm watching every word I say
Loving how I fade, fading like a flower
Knowing that the rain

Here in the golden mirror
Watch every word you say
Shatter and find a way
To cut like golden days"

On with your crime. It's not that I don't mind

To pass your time - your empty time

I left a little something on the altar for you

So poorly I've hidden knives
You will find them, you will find them
(My hidden knives)
So poorly I've hidden knives
You will find them, you'll find them
And we'll put pen to page

There is no mystery in my cadence
I've penned the end over smarter lines
But we both prefer romantic murder
To erase time and my, my empty life

I left a little something on the table for you

So poorly I've hidden knives
You will find them, you will find them

So poorly I've hidden knives
You will find them, you'll find them

AFI,Pink Eyes,AFI (The Blood Album),01/20/2017,"Not addicted to night, afraid of the morning
{That} I awake and feel like someone is here
But I'm laying right out, going darker and darker
When my skin peels away roses appear and I'll turn over

Find me in the corner of the round room
Reaching into dawn to find night blooms

Beauty, how you blind!
Give me a reason
Without sight
I will ever find you
And how you blind!
I know the reason
I can't stop touching my eyes

I'm allied to the night and warring the morning
I retreat into the dark if someone is near
You can lay me right out with the right kind of flower
When my senses slip away lilies appear

In the hot house you'll find me
Staring at the end, again, in rapture

Beauty, how you blind!
Give me a reason
Without sight
I will ever find you
And how you blind!
I know the reason
I can't stop

I lick my fingers
(Lick my fingers)
Make my tongue go numb
(Make my tongue go numb)
I chew you from beneath my nails
(Make my tongue go numb)
Put your petals in my mouth
Put your petals in my mouth

And how you blind!
I know the reason
I can't stop touching my eyes"

Deep in my heart, a disbeliever
Only inviting in the truth

Tell me it's better way up there. I need you. I need you
I need you to tell me

Does it feel the same
After healing, fame
And all the strange, strange, strange behavior?
Does it make it worse?
They mispronounce the hurt
I feel so strange, I'm still a stranger

Is there the misunderstanding that there's a hit of healing light?
Tell me the cuts finally stop showing before we kiss, again, the night
Here in the dark, tripping your picture I keep rehanging on the wall
I need you better way up there. I need you. I need you better

So much deceit a shadow follows every beat
There's a dark force it's so real it's attacking how you feel
Every minute of our lives

We have to fight for humanity
The people of the world are one family
The human heart is broken dark forces are open
Battleground is everywhere you see

We've survived with the pain of a million lives
Now its time to push through to a world we've never known
There's a dark force it's so real it's attacking how we feel
Every minute of our lives

We have to fight this insanity
With love from the center of our gravity
The human heart is broken dark forces are open
Battleground is inside you and me

Love will win this fight, Love is our true right
Love will win this fight

The Menzingers,Thick as Thieves,After the Party,01/30/2017,"I held up a liquor store
Demanding top shelf metaphors
Sinner's smile and open arms
Drop a line to charm the silent alarm
Neutral angels calling the cops
They'll be choosing sides when the fighting stops
Polizia in the cabaret
While we six kings made our getaway

Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between
With an ocean in between

Laughter in the darkness
Whispers in the shadows
I was there when the wall fell down
I'll be there when the ocean rises
Building castles of cans and bottles
Drinking like they do in novels
Know they'll catch me by and by
But tonight you are my alibi

Same old sun that we all come from
Faded stars in the air that we breathe
In the earth, in the sea

Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between

Into the procession of a black mass
Oh how the subject at the altar wants their life back

It's bored beyond repair and unfit for an altar
It's strange relating with the lamb to the slaughter

But hey, do you really want to throw it away?
Do you really want to throw it away?
I'd do anything to make you stay

We used to only take the back roads
But now we found a distance shorter
You used to call me darling
Now you prefer more formal
We used to get high and stare at the moon
And wonder how long it would take to walk to
But now that's like the distance between me and you

But hey, do you really want to throw it away?
Do you really want to throw it away?
I'd do anything to make you stay

For just a little, just a little bit longer

The boy blue with the silver spoon
They found him dying in the living room
Say goodbye to the bride and groom
Send them off on their honeymoon

Dreadful sound echoed through the trees
Dirty headlights put us on our knees
Route 502, we were waiting for you
But you couldn't see
It was New Year's Eve
Wait with me

The boy blue with the silver spoon
They found him dying in the living room
Say goodbye to the bride and groom
Send them off on their honeymoon

I've been told there's no going home
No room for you and me
No empty seats in eternity
I've been told no going home
No song left to sing
No second act to mortality

The boy blue with the silver spoon
They found him dying in the living room
Say goodbye to the bride and groom
Send them off on their honeymoon

The life I've painted I've sold for a quick twenty
It's on display now for the privileged and the wealthy
God, I despise their reassuring, lying eyes
Our home stands tall behind that foreclosure sign
Everything in boxes from another lifetime
Continental breakfast in the lobby
But they're always out of coffee
Only a fool would think living could be easy
Only a fool would think living could be easy
This little motel room on I-80 west of nowhere
Why count the stars?
You'll never know where you are
Somewhere light years from the world you used to know
Like a lock that doesn't turn
Like a plant that doesn't grow
Long for the words with hearts and wings
From five states over, I'm running from everything
Continental breakfast in the lobby
But they're always out of coffee
Only a fool would think living could be easy
Only a fool would think living could be easy
Oh you know it breaks my heart
Watching your whole life fall apart
While bastards dance off with the night
As we try to break free with all our might
Only a fool would think living could be easy

Been having problems with our landlord
He said he's taking us both to court
She got her hours slashed
And my unemployment's drying up fast
We both got worthless diplomas from worthless universities
Two bachelors in worthless studies
But at least it made our parents happy
And cost a whole lot of money
You said LA's only two days if we drive straight
Denver if we get tired
Said you didn't mind stopping just as long as we got out of the midwest states

The midwestern states
The midwestern states
The midwestern states
But I know somewhere in Chicago where we can stay for a little
I hope this isn't a burden
Thanks for having us over
Most nights we always fall asleep with something dumb on Netflix
Some nights trash reality or kids cartoons or shitty documentaries
Not perfect but we're good together
Yeah, me, you, and our bad tattoos
Yeah, all our stick and pokes, all our inside jokes
We'll regret them when we're dead and sober
But we're still breathing and the party ain't over

Like a wedding ring that never fit right
Like a car alarm that won't stop howling
A decade lost in the motions to romance and cheap whiskey
The subtle sound of a fleeting feeling
Like four chords that don't love you no more
In a motel room, a sleeping bag on the floor

Where have my friends gone?
Can't stand these people no more
But you cannot leave when you can't find the door
Smashed my phone, lost my wallet
Who's this new friend of mine?
Why do some people make you nervous
And others drive you to drink when the bars are closing?
Nightstand memorial to past libation
A sudden fear of phone vibrations
Too hung over to sleep
Too tired to stay alive
Benzos, bile, and bills
There's so much missing time to kill
I shake like an airplane on its way down
Why do some people make you nervous
And others drive you to drink when the bars are closing?
When the bars are closing
No good'll come from stumbling home with the sun
No good'll come from stumbling home with the sun

You rest your head against the window pane
Feet on the dash through the steady rain

After a show at the Stone Pony
Watch you awake so god damn sweetly
Over the Walt Whitman Bridge back to Philly

I toss and turn at four in the morning
Petrified of where our future's going
'Cause you're the kind of girl that deserves the world
I'm just the kind of guy that promises the world
So I fix a drink nice and strong in the kitchen
Something quick that'll cure my conscience
Creep back to bed and I kiss your forehead
Maybe everything is fine and it's all in my head

A little Polish in your name
A little Boston in your attitude

Your old house was just like you remember
We stayed in your adolescent room
Rummaged through the boxes labeled ""former you""
The souvenirs of happiness in the moment
Your wild years that you often mention
The sands of time in an hourglass
That you're always begging for back
I got drunk in the afternoon
With your father in the living room
As the television broke the silence
You smiled, knowing that I was trying
The best that I can do

Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights

I can't wait 'til I'm off of work
I'll meet my friends at the Target curb
I rolled my ankle, Matt just broke his wrist
I climbed through your window at 3am
We listened to The Smiths and The Violent Femmes
Yeah, we both sang, ""Why can't I get one kiss?""

We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot

We are the broken
No end in sight
We're the forgotten soldiers you left behind
There's no use trying
We lost the war
Now the dead and dying
Are back to even the score

We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot"
All Time Low,Last Young Renegade,Last Young Renegade,03/24/2017,"Just a couple kids on a summer street
Chasing around to a flicker beat
Making mistakes that were made for us
We brushed them off like paper cuts

You said you're sick and tired of it, it
But I need you morning, night, and day
I miss you every single way-ay-ay
We said forever but forever wouldn't wait for us

You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
We had to say goodbye

Underneath the lights of a motorway
That's where I go to keep your ghost away
We used to be such a burning flame
Now we're just smoke in the summer rain

You said you're sick and tired of it, it
But I need you morning, night, and day
I miss you every single way-ay-ay
We said forever but forever wouldn't wait for us

You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
We had to say goodbye
I want to know that you're somewhere out there
Somewhere down this road
You were my last young renegade heartache
How could I let you, how could I let you go?

You were the best thing that ever happened to me
And I'll keep on fighting just to make you believe

You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling

I barely made it out alive
I'm not bent, I'm not cracked
I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea
I wrapped my car around a tree
Hold me up, underneath
This heavy burden

There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

Tied up to a heart of stone
I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home
Lay with me, I can't sleep
Misery loves company
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked
When I'm broken

There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone

Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake, and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone

I don't need anyone

That you only live once way of thinking
It's so twisted are you living or just wasted
An escape 'cause you can't face it

I think I'd believe him

After everyone self-destructs
Pop the hatch and we'll climb back up

Of themselves then changing features
Pleasing over critical creatures

Moving like the waves of the ocean

You just want to tie yourself to the mast

At least in your mind

Learn to swim in rushing rivers
Breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm

This shitty guitar needs some personality
This shitty song needs some personality

Your hollow accusations no one ever hears
Your wounded senses of pride, a guilty souvenir
All your protests and vacant excuses ring insincere
(This song needs some fucking personality)
I just want to find a car to overturn
I just want to light a fire to watch it burn
Now we're past the point of no return and no one is here

Learn to swim in rushing rivers
Breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm

This song needs some fucking personality
Anybody? Somebody?
Give me some fucking personality!
What happened to personality?

You are afraid
Uneducated on where this would lead
Going on for far too long
We are sorry for the greed
Leave us in pieces and places
War-torn and wronged
In between whispers and screams
You permeate my soul
Lost between nightmares and dreams
You decimate this home

Learn to swim in rushing rivers
Breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm

Oops I, did it again, I forgot what I was losing my mind about
Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message: I was young and a menace

Woke up on the wrong side of reality
And there's a madness that's just coursing right through me
And as far as the time, far as the time

Clearly I was crazy
The first to give advice
Played it up like I was noble
But I was feeding my own pride
The lengths I'd go for a fix
Tacky charm got me far
Must have hurt so many feelings
While stabbing my own heart

I damn the world, shooting fire from my eyes

Paramore,26,After Laughter,05/12/2017,"Man, you really know how to get someone down
Everything was fine, until you came around
And I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground?
Man, you really brought me back down

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

You got me tied up, but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you said
When you gonna hear me out?
Man, you really bring me down

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died
So let it break your heart

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me"

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle

I was dreamin' life away
All the while just going blind
Can't see the forest for the trees
Behind the lids of my own eyes

Nostalgia's cool, but it won't help you now
A dream is good, if you don't wear it out

And I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle

Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

And if I go out tonight
And dress up my fears
You think I look alright with these mascara tears?
See, I'm gonna draw up my lipstick wider than my mouth
And if the lights are low, they'll never see me frown

Every word is a bullet hole
Shot a hole in the sun
If I never look up maybe I'll never notice

And you, you want forgiveness
But I, I just can't do it yet

There's still a thread that runs from your body to mine
And you can't break what you don't see, an invisible line
If I follow it down, will we just be alright?
But it could take me all your life to learn to love
How I thought I could love someone
I haven't even begun
If it's all up to us we might as well give up

And you, you want forgiveness

I won't break my neck to get around it

Down from this pedestal that you keep putting me on
What if I fall on my face? What if I make a mistake?
If it's okay a little grace would be appreciated
Remember how we used to like ourselves?
What little light that's left, we need to keep it sacred
I know that you're afraid to let all the dark escape you

Paramore,No Friend,After Laughter,05/12/2017,"These old letters from years ago
I felt it was leading to a continued
 I hope this is helpful for you.
When I wrote this letter I felt I may have been finally able to address how it feels

Another brick-red room, another black-top town
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
Another star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray
Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
Another song that runs too long, God knows no one needs
More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot! dance
Beneath another burning sky, behind our painted lips
In scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships
So throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
As protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me
When this repetition ends behind the window shades
A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made
That most unrestful bed, that most original of sins
And you'll say that's what I get when I let ambitions win again
I'd hate to let you down so I'll let the waters rise
And drown my dull reflection in the naive expectation in your eyes
Back in a cast bit-part, back when I felt most free
I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me
So before the regiment resumes, before the dreaded sun appears
My driver's waiting, so let's make one point crystal clear:
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You see a flood-lit form
I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine

I see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realising that what they see may not be even close to the image I see in myself
And I hate I might actually be more afraid
 I feel like they know the story
I saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
Twelve years ago I stood on the shore
Jump in and grab the coat
And the river is rushing toward a waterfall
And my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
I let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me
In any case please let me know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful"
Paramore,Pool,After Laughter,05/12/2017,"As if the first cut wasn't deep enough
I dove in again 'cause I'm not into giving up
Could've gotten the same rush from any lover's touch
But why get used to something new?
'Cause no one breaks my heart like you

When you kiss me, I wish we could see what happens next
For a moment, I could forget what happens in my head
If I doubt you, would you come through?
Happy second chance or happy ending
But this time you don't leave me sinking

(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
I went further out to see what else was left of us
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
Drain the fantasy of you
Headfirst into shallow pools

And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
The illusion, can shatter before we begin
If you're really sorry
Happy second chance, think I could forgive
This time you won't leave me sinking

(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

Dive back into
Right back into
Dive right back into you
And now I know you
Now I know you
Now that I know you
Dive right back into you
Back into
Right back into you
Dive right back into you
And now I know you
Now I know you
Now that I know you
Dive right back into you

Just starting something new again
I'm getting sick of the beginnings

Caught up in a hurricane

Angry words from down the hall

Now there's a ghost in the back of this room
And I don't like it
I fall asleep with my covers pulled up
And try to fight it
I gotta say it's hard to be brave
When you're alone in the dark

Digging up old memories
Always used to be the one to let it go
Kept my fears in a suitcase
I locked them away
In a place they wouldn't find
They still haunt me

And the moon sang a melody
Well, it shined down on you
I get by in time, well, 'cause we're here for a very short run
And hold the gate 'cause we're comin'
There'll be room for everyone
By the time that train was leavin'
We were stranded at the end of the line
And the moon sang a melody
Well, it shined down on you
Tangled up and troubled
Man, life ain't an easy road
You see, there's always time to get in trouble
And you will always make it back home
Well, the life starts on San Pablo
And I walked up to Albany Hill
And the moon sang a melody
Well, it shined down on you
And the moon sang a melody that shined down on...you!
You know that it's true!
Shined down on you
It's true!
Shined down on you

When it'll run out
Sooner or later
I'll be hit by a bus any day now
Are your eyes blocked by cataracts
You can't see how good you have it
You're taking a smile for granted

You're gonna wake up twenty years from now
Wishing you gave two shits about
All the lost moments you can never get back
You'd trade it for anything
Look back twenty years from now
Wondering why you cared about
Getting all the last words
Just to hear your own voice
But you weren't saying anything

When all goes your way
Your thoughts dissolve to nothing
We learn to walk from falling
So I'll kiss the curb

You're gonna wake up twenty years from now
Wishing you gave two shits about
All the lost moments you can never get back
You'd trade it for anything
Look back twenty years from now
Wondering why you cared about
Getting all the last words
Just to hear your own voice
But you weren't saying anything

No longer I worry about a future I can't figure out

Sew the world together tightly
Cinch the gaps with pins and string
And the beacon out there on the wing
It lights the clouds from inside out
And from the ground we look like lightning

I feel the moonlight creeping in
Maybe it's all in my head

The bags under my eyes have got space when you bottom out

One day the things you love are gonna put you in the ground

Lost in the weeds
Bus stops and barbed wire on the way to stare
At the heart of the earth from the Poas peak
Just like the ones that we grew back in Jersey
Hung upside down, drying out for the wedding

There's a man with his head in his hands on the sidewalk
His wife's there behind him just off of the street
She scratches his back as he sobs on the asphalt
And what strikes me most is the symmetry
How they're framed just like you and me
When the light from the hospital's eastern wing
Tangles up in your hair and the sadness that pooled in my heart
Starts emptying slowly

Well I saw you last night in my dream
And there were hydrangeas where your face should be

The redwoods feel lonely and lunar and distant
The sun comes in fragments through breaks in the trees
And I feel further from home than I've ever been
These thin lines of light across space tether you to me
They pull in my memories, back to our apartment on 2nd Street
Through the South-facing window the light catches lengths of your hair
Like a path that you left me

Well I saw you last night in my dream
But there were azaleas where your face should be

Pieces of us in the morning sun
Sleeping bags under the 101
She takes off his glasses as he falls asleep again

And the ground below

Sad and sober, Sunday afternoon
You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon

I watched parts of you dissolve
Turn to ash and then get carried up
I watched your memory fade
Shadows burned into the wall
And no, I felt my lungs turn into atom bombs
Choke on the Florida heat until the oxygen's gone

You disappear in fragments and phases of the moon

Or the twelve-bar blues
Or a light in June

When the gray starts to swallow gray
Where the sky meets the Irish sea
Like a suit that's been to too many funerals
And starts fraying at the seams

In the Montmartre in Paris
Where the crows seem to know my name
And they left footprints in the snow
Along the fence on Palmer Street
Cigarette butts on the headstones
That you left for me

Just a block off the sea, you're a rowhome
On an empty street where the others have been torn down

I woke up blind with a headache
Grinding my teeth
Confused and alone and taking pills to sleep
They soften your absence but they don't let me dream

Raining in Kyoto
My breath turns into steam
I'll buy you a candle, not even sure what it means
But I cursed at the matches
And drown in my grief, grief
An older man stood close by, and smiled at me
I rung the bell like he did
I told you I'm sorry
A makeshift funeral, I tried to set you free

You're half asleep
And I bought you a radio to drown out the machines
Hospital light, you asked about the weather, wished that they'd let you outside

Raining in Kyoto
I'm starting to shake
They'll hold your service tomorrow
I'm an ocean away
Reached into my pocket, found a small paper crane
It's been over a year now
April turns into May
I've barely stopped moving, I've been so fucking afraid
Too much of a coward to even visit your grave

You're half awake
And I bought you a radio to play the blues away
With my hand to hold, you asked about the weather, wish they'd let you die at home

I wanna take you someplace safer
I wanna leave

I wanted to see how the light collects in the high desert heat
And you point to where the South Sister should be behind the clouds
I'm haunted by the ghosts of right now

The entire coast is out of water
It's turning different shades of grey
Like watching somebody you love
As they slowly waste away
And you looked skinny at my wedding
Sick of carrying the weight
Of all the doctors and all the treatments and all the reasons to be afraid

I wanted to see how the light collects in the high desert heat
And you point to where the South Sister should be behind the clouds
I'm haunted by the ghosts of right now
The ghosts of right now

I wanna take you someplace safer
I wanna take you someplace safer

I wanted to see how the light collects in the high desert heat
And you point to where the South Sister should be behind the clouds

The Wonder Years,The Ocean Grew Hands to Hold Me,Sister Cities,04/06/2018,"I stopped making deals with God
Right around when you left
I said that I would start believing
If they made you well again
Guess they knew it was bullshit
Never hold up my end
All the walls are stained in nicotine
I could feel closing in

I heard somebody cry
I thought I was alone
I came to numb my lungs in the salt air
Let the breakers heal my bones
I wish that the current would carry me home
I've been running for a decade now
And I think I'm ready to go
Oh, I'm ready to go

I stopped making deals with God
When the light finally died
I'm gonna guard what's left of the good in us
When the ash blocks out the sky
And hold you with my left hand
And ball up my right
And if the bastards come for both of us
I'll be right there by your side
I'm by your side

When I was in shambles
When I got too weak
The ocean grew hands to hold me
When I was in shambles
When I got too weak
The ocean grew hands to hold me

I stopped blaming God
When you said you were sick
I learned to lean on the people who love me
When the sutures start to split
I trust in the current to pull you back in
I miss everyone at once
But most of all, I miss the ocean"
The Wonder Years,The Orange Grove,Sister Cities,04/06/2018,"God, take me back to the orange grove
That I found deep in the desert
The air sweet as a miracle
It can't survive but it grows and grows and grows
West Texas is dying slow
An oil rig in the sunset
The air is heavy and filled with smoke
There ain't no quit in the hands that built this home
A dog barks in the distance
Rusted frames take root in the brush

You'll watch it decay
Lie through your teeth and say you'll resurrect a ghost
The paper tigers you made then swore to keep away
You're a knife there at my throat
God, take me back to the orange grove

Fall came quiet and sudden
They're smoking out of their storm doors
Work left town with the summer
We're just trying to keep warm
That cough don't sound any better
Another month, try to push through
Blood in your spit in the morning
Give a fake name at the emergency room
There at the edge of losing everything
Taking desperate swings in the dark

You'll watch it decay
Lie through your teeth and say you'll resurrect a ghost
The paper tigers you made then swore to keep away
You're a knife there at my throat

When your mom got sick so slow
Did you carry the weight alone?
When the bills started to grow
Did you carry the weight alone?
When the bank came for your home
Did you carry the weight alone?
When you reap what they sow
Do you carry the weight alone?

You'll watch it decay
Lie through your teeth and say you'll resurrect a ghost
The paper tigers you made then swore to keep away
You're a knife there at my throat
God, take me back to the orange grove"

In the ocean south of Sydney off the interstate
And I hold out my hand trying not to shake
Watched you jump off of a cliff
And start to levitate

And yeah I'm afraid
But I'll follow you anyway
When the blue finally came
It swallowed up everything

In the sea of trees
I thought that I'd hear ghosts in the waves
When the wind blew through
I heard joy return to a cold and lonesome place
I made out your voice, but I can't ask you to stay

Should I even love you anymore?

I'm too scared to look behind that door
I put my trust in all my faith
In every word between us spoken
Why do I believe the things you say
When my heart's already broken?

All this pain I feel
That's tearing me apart
Is what makes you real
Deep inside my heart

I can only count the ways
I earned these scars, but they're all tokens
Every time I see your face
I know my hopes no longer showing
I don't need a reason to believe
If my faith's already broken
How could I let love lead the way
When I don't know where I'm going?

All this pain I feel
That's tearing me apart
Is what makes you real
Deep inside my heart

I fought so hard
Still, I feel like I'm in chains
When I gave my heart
The darkness still remained

All this pain I feel
That's tearing me apart
Is what makes you real
Deep inside my heart

Tell me, why I hurt this way?
Should I even love you anymore?

And I let it break my heart
No, the pain don't go away
When the music stops
Thanks to everyone that bought tickets to my shows
I put all the money that you spent right up my nose

Haven't I given you enough?
Well I can fill a room full of faces I don't know

A piece of me in every song
I gave them all to you; five years of my life
And you still think that I've done you wrong

To the ones who feel alone
You can count on me when it all goes wrong

Love me or hate me
No one's gonna say you're wrong
But there's nothing you can do or say to me
That's gonna break me any more than I've already done
I've got a soft spot
For being fucked up
I've spent years alone and unloved
But I made it out
And I'm happy now
I'm your friend, I'm your brother, I'm your lover, I'm your son

Like time is not a crocodile

Weather's always nice inside my head
I turn my music up so loud
Tired of bullshit, drown it out
Everything is fine and nothing matters anyway

Pull the curtains back
I think my neighborhood's on fire again
The kids are not alright it seems
At least they went outside this time
The gunshot has gone off
But I am swimming in a footrace
There's no finish line in sight
And they already gave the first place medal

I don't mind
I don't mind

Everything is fine and nothing matters
Weather's always nice inside my head
I turn my music up so loud
Tired of bullshit, drown it out
Everything is fine and nothing matters anyway

All of it
I'm gonna take this life and make it here with you

MxPx,Disaster,MxPx,07/25/2018,"Sittin' in my car drinking from a flask
Layin' future plans, worked up the nerve to ask
Nothin' can prepare you for the way we all fail
We're so in love it just doesn't seem real

I'm such a disaster for you
No one else can work faster for you
I'm such a disaster for you
I can't stand up straight
I'm fallin' over, over and over

Stuck in the middle of a hurricane
Comin' at you fast, the days have gone insane
When I need peace I find it back at home
You are my anchor no matter where this vessel goes

I'm such a disaster for you
No one else can work faster for you
I'm such a disaster for you
I can't stand up straight
I'm fallin' over

I had the best time with you
Running around the house with, all wrapped in
Wishin' this moment was more than we're lasting
I find myself callin' you
I find myself callin' you
I find myself callin' you
Yeah you
I find myself callin' you

I'm such a disaster for you
No one else can work faster for you
I'm such a disaster for you

MxPx,Friday Tonight,MxPx,07/25/2018,"How did we make it this far?
How did we learn to stay alive?
How did my head not separate my body from my mind?
How did the planets get aligned?
How is it every single time?

I'm in the kitchen, you're in the kitchen
In the god damn refrigerator
I've always loved that line
I say it every time

Like tonight
It's Friday tonight, tonight, tonight
It's really fine
It's Friday tonight, tonight, tonight
It's Friday tonight
Friday tonight
Friday tonight, tonight, tonight

How would you change your life if you could never die?
Would you do good or do crime?
How is it every single time?

How crazy would you be?
How crazy would you go
If you had everything and lost it in the flow?
You win some, you lose some
But you live, you live to fight another day

I've always loved that line
I say it every time

MxPx,Life Goals,MxPx,07/25/2018,"Broken friendships  come in at rivals
Don't believe  those hyped up  bottles
Those messed up thoughts are not your own
Someone are shared with, some are going alone
Why love momma now that your boy is grown
You swear your thoughts are not your own

One day you're walking around
The next day you're no where to be found
Now you're buried six feet underground

To live the best, live the life of no regret
, some are true and holds us fast
And it's good to have life goals
And it's good to have life goals

 a way off course
Made afraid when  discourse
All the way to hell like a tour de force

One day you're walking around
Next day you're no where to be found
Better to keep it under cover
One day you're walking around
The next day you're no where to be found
Now you're buried six feet underground

A bridge to nowhere
Still takes you somewhere
But you'll never know
Until you get there

Raise up the bar and looking back with no regret
Death comes up close, that's a life that most don't get
But it's good to have life goals
It's good to have life goals"
MxPx,Moments Like This,MxPx,07/25/2018,"These are what times, where so many blue skies turn gray
At the end of each night we get ready for work the next day
Don't you ever lose heart, keep the fire burning ablaze
And don't call me crazy, It's just the way I was raised

It's moments like this, that I'm gonna miss
When I'm dead and gone and I can't kiss my kids
Will they look up to the sky and think about me
These are the ways I be spendin' my days
Thinkin' weird thoughts and things that amaze me
About life and the way I've been able leave it so free
It's moments like this
That are priceless to me
Yea-yeah, Yea-yeah, Yea-yeah
Priceless to me
Yea-yeah, Yea-yeah

I heard the screen door as it slammed all the hours of the day
It's so hot outside, I don't move, I'm just meltin' in place
Possessions are lost and gone without so much as a trace
Time keeps on tickin' each second replaced

I can't imagine it now
Didn't want to think of it then
Thought I'd resisted some how
But I was wrong again
We all hide from truth
The Truthist will see
We are all beautiful, yet deadly afraid

It's moments like this, that I'm gonna miss
When I'm dead and gone and I can't kiss my kids
Will they look up to the sky and think about me
These are the ways I be spendin' my days
Thinkin' weird thoughts and things that amaze me
About my life and the way I've been able live it so free
It's moments like this
That are priceless to me

MxPx,Pipe Dreams,MxPx,07/25/2018,"I'm building a skyline, I'm wondering where my surprise went
The blueprints keep changing, the cold keeps on breaking
It must be the intent

Pick all my pockets and take what you need, all you'll find
Just leave me a shred of humanity, leave me my mind

Hold on
Hold on to those pipe dreams
If I'm wrong
The worst is already happening
Hold on, hold on
No reason we can't have pipe dreams

Faced with a nation divided, engaged in reality star wars
There's no indication that we didn't crawl out like rats from the sewers

Pick all my pockets and take what you need, all you'll find
Just leave me a shred of humanity, leave me my mind

Hold on
Hold on to those pipe dreams
If I'm wrong
The worst is already happening
Hold on, hold on
No reason we can't have pipe dreams

Infrastructure and pipeline
Now they're broken supply lines
All my vision is too clear
All that's hidden must be fear
Oh yeah
Must be fear

MxPx,The Way We Do,MxPx,07/25/2018,"I break my neck to give my family all they need
If giving blood was asked of me, then blood I'll bleed
If the earth opens up and somehow swallows me
Let me live on through the songs and stories

Like that time
When Face To Face destroyed our van
Our freezing balls, crossed Canada with Simple Plan
Or stealing third, from Bad Religions dressing room
Some night that old bus felt like a tomb

This is the way we do
Like the way we always wanted to
Its true, It's true
This is the way we do
This is the way we make this moment last past midnight like teenagers out past curfew
Yeah

I've failed so many times it don't bother me
Life will send us lessons like they grow on trees
There's no shortcuts in this life, so far that I've seen
But here are here we are where while I'm living the dream
Here we are where while I'm living the dream

Like that time we toured across America
And found we loved every corner of
This great green world and yet it's lonely on some nights
Crack the door and leave on the lights

This is the way we do
Like the way we always wanted to
Its true, It's true
This is the way we do
This is the way we make this moment last past midnight like teenagers out past curfew
Yeah"
MxPx,Uptown Streets,MxPx,07/25/2018,"On a Saturday night, in the year of the Summer of Sam
I was truly scared, for the first nine years I ran
It was a mighty fine day in the USA I bet
Wrote it on the back of my hand so I wouldn't forget

Those uptown streets
We all drive down
They may be worn out, be at broken, and yet somehow
They carry so many
Of us to safety
Those uptown streets
We walk those now

Gotta keep your eyes wide open all the time
Gotta keep your focus on the bigger prize
I was buying one at the corner store
Riding BMX like a paper delivery boy

Those uptown streets
We all drive down
They may be worn out, be at broken, and yet somehow
They carry so many
Of us to safety
Those uptown streets
We walk those now

Yeah
We still walk those streets
We still walk those streets

We all drive down
They may be worn out, be at broken, and yet somehow
They carry so many
Of us to safety

We walk those now"

We don't have to stop right now
It only hurts when the night runs out
You said you're tired and you wanted to go home

Is this what the clouds feel like?
Never really happy, just quiet and polite
Surrounded and lonely at the same time

Don't you wish it was Friday forever?
Don't you wish the sun never came up?
Don't you miss being day drunk together?
I'll still be waiting if you ever get stuck

Only ones left awake in the world
Counting the stars

Trophy Eyes,A Cotton Candy Sky,The American Dream,08/03/2018,"I can see
There's a storm coming in
Watch from the back porch
As you play with the kids
You stop to smile
And wave to me

If that ain't home
I don't know what is

Long blonde hair
And your sun-tanned skin
Bare foot in
Your little yellow dress
The summer rain makes the sound of the trees
I see you laughing
As you come running in

If that ain't home
I don't know what is"
Trophy Eyes,A Symphony Of Crickets,The American Dream,08/03/2018,"Put out my last cigarette for a while
As a symphony of crickets announce the night
In the chorus I am deafened by the light
Of paying for my years, twenty-five
'Cause I'd have killed myself by now if not for you
I know you hate it when I say it, but it's true

'Cause baby I ain't got nothing
Baby I ain't got nothing
If I don't have you

Staring at the dead leaves in a backyard pool
Where did my life go?
What a spectacular view
All those old Irish songs at my grandfather's funeral
Seventeen candles on a birthday cake
Seems like yesterday

Fell in and out of love and hard drugs
Found my heart in Los Angeles

I don't have any answers for you kid
I'm still figuring out what I'm doing here
Keep your home in your heart
It keeps you out of the rain
Don't let those sad songs rot your brain

I'll hold the wheel while you light your cigarette
Burning down the highway out of here
My twenties clipping at my heels
I've been killing myself just to know how it feels

Laid out on my childhood bed
To the sound of 'Sam's Town' and my hands behind my head

I don't have any answers for you kid
I'm still figuring out what I'm doing here
Keep your home in your heart
It keeps you out of the rain
Don't let those sad songs rot your brain

Ask me again why I'm never really here
Nothing has to leave when it lives in my head
Ask me again why I'm never really here
Nothing lives forever, but it lives in my head

I don't have any answers for you kid
I'm still figuring out what I'm doing here
Keep your home in your heart
It keeps you out of the rain
Don't let those sad songs rot your brain

Trophy Eyes,I Can Feel It Calling,The American Dream,08/03/2018,"I woke up drunk in a cab out the front of my house
''Hey man, this is your stop, yeah, it's time to get out''
And what I wouldn't give to be standing at your door
When I can't find the words to stop the hurting no more
Through the nights I wake up alone in my sheets soaking wet
To the sound of your voice saying 'come home' still ringing in my ear
And this world's got a funny way of being cruel to me
Still I raise my chin and fuckin' eat it with a smile on my face

If you blink, you're gonna miss me
If you blink, you're gonna miss me
I'm gonna burn up in the atmosphere
If you blink, you're gonna fucking miss me

Sometimes I forget my life is bigger than this city block
But when I turn on south warren, I feel the curtains come up
I can't shake the feeling
If I can't run, I'll crawl
Nothing can hurt me now
I'm home-bound
I said nothing can hurt me now
I'm home-bound

Baby, why don't we get out of here?
All I wanna do is take your hand and disappear
(Disappear, just disappear)

All I wanna do is take your hand and disappear

You never know what your heart's for until it breaks
Well when you've got no one to mend it
You're left with that empty space
I got a song in my head for all of the places I've known
I can hear you singing in the shower now
Baby, I'm coming home

If you blink, you're gonna miss me

I just wanna see my name light up the streets
Or it was all for nothing, all for nothing

Life is like a double-sided coin
We play along is if we ever really had the choice
The difference is what I did with mine

It don't make much sense right now

A short walk to the corner store
To spend the small change in my hand
A young man tore his body apart
Right in front of my house on the train tracks
The suits turned their heads to the smell of death
For broken bones, or a spot of blood
And police lights, flash like Christmas nights
In celebration that it wasn't me, this time

Waking up in the same old skin
It ain't easy to believe
We were born for something bigger than this

It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out
It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out

I imagine a pale square of paint in the hallway
Where your portrait used to hang
Your family couldn't stand the heartache
So they took your picture down and left your room the same
I ain't ever left a scar like that
But that's all we have when people think of us when we're dead
We all find ourselves at the train tracks
The good die young and the old die bitter singing

It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out
It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out
It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out
It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out

And my life flashed before my eyes
And I didn't care how we left it
I'm still flying through my twenties
Waiting for someone to say I made it
Golden boy, tiny pay check
Big ideas and broken heartstrings
Waking up in the same old skin
It ain't easy to believe
We were born for something bigger than this

It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out
It don't make much sense right now

This goddamn thing's the worst
Now one look in that direction
And everything starts to hurt
Is this thing cursed?
It's been around for years
And everytime my boat's about tits up
That goddamn thing is near

I tried to throw it in the river
But it washed up in my sink
And now the city cut my water
And it's all I have to drink

Is this thing cursed?
If it is then I'm the jerk
Who keeps on hanging around
When I simply should just burn it to the ground
Maybe it's some kind of spell
That I've been living under
Collecting coins found near a nightmare wishing well
Coldest regards signed my name and sealed the card
Tried to leave it all behind me and almost blew up in my car
Is this thing cursed?
Is this thing cursed?

Is this thing cursed?
My haunted head aches so much worse
Than those that can't remember
How dismemberment works
*Is this thing cursed?
It's been around for years
And everytime my life's about tits up

It's not just me, things seemed much sunnier back then

Doesn't really make a difference to me
Take a bunch of pills and crash in to me
Do it again for old time's sake

To say ""I think I'm still in love""

Good Charlotte,Prayers,GENERATION Rx,08/31/2018,"Born on a lonely planet full of broken dreams
Where no one understands me
When I finally met an angel, I didn't know what to say
She just held my hand
And we would lay awake at night, looking at the stars
Thinking of the ones we've lost, and wonder where they are
When we lit another candle, she asked me who's to blame
Then she put her arms around me and held me to the flame

So why do we hurt each other?
We don't need the words for one another's

Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
Do they answer when you call?
These prayers, when you don't mean what you say
Would you die for me today? Now I just can't relate

None of this makes sense in this reality
God just leaves the room when I turn on my TV
I see a little girl who's crying 'cause she lost her family
All these strangers sending thoughts and prayers, she's buried underneath

Why do we kill each other?
We can't feel the pain in one another's

Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
Do they answer when you call?
These prayers, when you don't mean what you say
Would you die for me today? Now I just can't relate

We're so far away from one another
We keep building walls between each other's

Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
Do they answer when you call?
These prayers, when you don't mean what you say
Would you die for me today? Now I just can't relate

Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all

The sound, the screams, the mourning
As we send sympathy cards

Hydrocodone acid-washed brain
A shame, a total loss
They said that they did all they could
That boy's been dead since childhood
Leave me alone to analyze
The sour power of surprise
A ticker out of time and whack
Too young to die of heart attacks

I guess I should be going, there's nothing I can say
To keep your dad from throwing up at least 3 times a day
They found you Christmas morning beneath the tree in the backyard
The pounding of your mother's fist while freezing in the car

They said that they did all they could
That boy's been dead since childhood
Leave me alone to analyze
The sour power of surprise

Casket to carry
Try not to think (Try not to think)
About you dead and buried

We passed out in the shadows
Of a lonely Thursday night

We kissed away our memories
And fucked away the pain
We went out for some coffee
And then we did it all again
My Krystalline
Ooh ooh I want you Krystalline
Ooh ooh I want you Krystalline

Couldn't tell what you were thinking
The night I turned up at the bar
I told you I quit drinking
And you laughed til you saw stars
I came to Santa Monica
With flowers in my hand
I grabbed you by the lips with mine
And slowly pulled you in

We kissed away our memories
And fucked away the pain
You called in sick to work
Then we did it all again

I couldn't pay for it and they stripped it for parts
Now just look at my shoes, oh I sure could use a lift

I lit a cigarette then I passed the fuck out

The man I'd become was so comfortably dumb
I believe you could mean it, but you're not having fun
And I'm sorry

I learned to breathe I guess some time ago

I'm lousy with excuses and you know I love to swear
So goddamnit, I swear to whatever's out there
And I love you more now than I ever have, so

Let's pick another day to call it quits and walk away
Let's find some other time to break down
The storm has gone and blown on through
Shake off the darkness, and I will too
You might leave me still, but not today
For now, can we just stay?
Can we just stay?

You would think by now that I'd be fine
Y'know, like really stretching out
But it would all be lies
I'm no longer in control of my own shoes
There they go
Quickly running out of booze
Drinking to kill myself to live without you
Over there, where I'm still scared
Sometimes

At home with the notion it's me, myself, and I

I was the live fast, car crash, Mulholland Drive
Open the flood gates, this love-hate is making me cry
But tears fill the tub with the blood from your wrist that night

If we should live forever
Like sweet vampires
When we can reign together
Our own empire
Now we should try to sever
All our past ties
But it's me and you
And the skies are blue
Both bleeding from our eyes

I was a love-sick, dumb dick, top off the stock
Came to shove, when you push and locked his keys in his car
I feel like an animal that's been kicked around too long
An eel who's electric circuitry that's been wired all wrong

If we should live forever
Like sweet vampires
When we can reign together
Our own empire
Now we should try to sever
All our past ties
But it's me and you
And the skies are blue
Both bleeding from our eyes

Now where the hell have you
Gone off and flown away to
Some shithole you call home (some asshole)
Told me I won't survive
Somehow, I'm scraping by
We're reduced to ruin
Rubble, rags and bones

If we should live forever
Like sweet vampires
When we can reign together
Our own empire
Now we should try to sever
All our past ties
But it's me and you

About who did deserve this dirty wealth, whoa
Baby when we die, yeah we're all gonna burn in hell

Dog at the door who's the king of hardcore, 'cause he's always been
Booking the shows where they sell the most clothes 'cause they're so limited

Trying to decide who is good
And who's just poor, whoa
Baby when we die, yeah, we're all gonna want some more"
Joyce Manor,Up The Punx,Million Dollars To KIll Me,09/21/2018,"Once before a cold explorer
Sheet like pain of fleeting horror
""So not-posh"", I'm not believing
Goes non-stop before careening

Down the stairs and 'round the block
I stepped into a china shop
And turned my headlamp towards the ceiling
Can't believe the feeling

Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there this time?

Up the punx, I feel so freakish
All too real to deal with sequence
Broke-a-hontas, orange eating
Talk like that, now watch who's screaming

Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there this time? this time?"
Joyce Manor,Wildflowers,Million Dollars To KIll Me,09/21/2018,"Sunshine, coming in through
The open window of my bedroom

Wildflowers at the side of the road
Caught my eye, and turned my heart to stone

""Hey man, are you okay?""
That was all that I heard somebody say

Wildflowers, I am shot with a song
Totally devastated for so long

Wildflowers, I am lost in a dream
Why are we still pretending to believe?"
Saves the Day,Kerouac & Cassady,9,09/26/2018,"Saturday night in a stranger's car
To an aftershow at a purple bar
700 long-lost friends and first avenue stars
Friday flying at 4 AM in an indigo sky
With Houdini's twin
Six months into a crisscross zig-zag tour

Come on, let's go
Let's get lost
Climb in a big black van
On the road again
Come on, let's go
We're taking off
Playing our favorite songs on the radio

Thursday sailin' on 8 miles high
A Caribbean Sea where penguins fly
Groundhog Day on a loop on a five hour flight
Wednesday sleepwalk around backstage
When 10:10 flashes in neon green
Drown in silver light before a four hour show

Come on, let's go
Let's get lost
Climb in a big black van
On the road again
Come on, let's go
We're taking off
Playing our favorite songs on the radio

Tuesday lost in city streets
Find four-leaf clovers where highways meet
Three detours later, U-turn at a yellow light
Monday swing from a chandelier, peeling oranges
Drinking American beer
Two floors down get caught in a revolving door

Sunday drive to the next airport
One oxblood boot on a black dashboard
20 years into a lifelong endless tour"

Send down an angel and bring 'em a booze

Go with that urge to sit back and recline
When the sunset turns red we drink wine
Dance all night, lose our minds

This and the next world

Here's to the loved ones

May your cup never empty
Your heart never bruise to blue

Shake that ass to the beat of the band
Drinking whiskey in a bar with your friends
Ain't that great? Ain't that grand?

Until that day comes don't let up, we must not fall asleep

Pounding in my head in the blue-black night

Heard it in your blue skies
Singing in the air in the morning light
Blue skies mesmerize me
Laughing like a clock on the wall

Hear it on the radio
Playing in the car with the windows down
Radio electrifies me
Louder than the Liberty Bell
Before the first word I ever said

We were driving in my mother's car
Chicago-Minnesota overnight
Over the frozen overpass over black ice

Before and after
What if it had never happened?
Before and after
No way to know what's gonna happen

Cop shades up, hiding my eyes
In La Crosse for seven nights
Out of touch and out of sight
Broken wing and fractured mind

Before and after
What if it had never happened?
Before and after
No way to know what's gonna happen

Still seems strange, water, wine, and X-rays
White pills for pain and faces change in days
I saw you from above, upside down
There in the corner of our hotel room
The door was open, 432

Walked out on a spine three years later with you
Got lost in the Badlands, took a picture or two
Now I wish you were here to share the view
But you're gone

Before and after
What if it had never happened?
Before and after
No way to know what's gonna happen

Still seems strange, water, wine, and X-rays
White pills for pain and faces change in days
I saw you from above, upside down
There in the corner in our hotel room
The door was open, 432


Wrote you nineteen messages
And I can see you didn't read them
So I'll say it again
Got my phone in my hand and it's 3 AM
Gonna drive all night 'til the highway ends
I know you'll say I'm on the edge
And if you're not so wrong
Could you lend a hand?

Come on, come on, come on
Please pick up the phone

Tangerine pink cassette tapes
And stacks of compact discs I saved
Laughing and pointing, you narrow your eyes
Turning all of my friends into your allies
Might have been born in a crossfire hurricane
But don't think twice, it wasn't yesterday

Come on, come on, come on
Please pick up the phone
Come on, come on, come on
Please pick up the

Wonder if I'm ever gonna see your call
But you already know I loved you all along
And it's all in the past and I can't forget
'Cause I still hear your voice echo in my head
At your parents' house on Leap Year Day
At the surprise party you planned for me
We're outside walking to your door
You're laughing in moonlight

Come on, come on, come on
Please pick up the phone
Come on, come on, come on
Please pick up the phone


If I could take back all the things I wish I never said
I wish I never felt the way I did the day you left
I was a stupid kid, twenty-something
Watching myself sing on TV
No way to know that there's
No way to know what to expect
Suddenly it's as if it's almost overnight success
Somehow lightning in a bottle ricochets
Lights a spark underground

And on the corner of Victorian & 21st
On Halloween, I step outside and see you standing
There the light is shining, smiling in your green eyes
Like starlight through diamonds

When I met you, I was on my own
Twenty-two, living alone
Wasted on the cover of a magazine
Singing from my heart, sad love song
Stranger from the start, what went wrong?
And then there you are and it's getting better
Without you, I was lost forever

On an endless night, on an endless drive
I read your words about a thousand times
Saying things like there's a lazy moon outside
Right now, can you see it laying on its side?
I wake up way too early, stay up way too late
Trying to picture your face
Please send a polaroid, get it that Saturday
Your yellow envelope I still have to this day

I was a sideways zig-zag, upside down
Stuck tongue-tied, crisscrossed X's
Where my eyes once were and the light that was gone
Before I met you, somehow came back on

When I met you, I was on my own
Twenty-two, living alone
Wasted on the cover of a magazine
Singing from my heart, sad love song
Stranger from the start, what went wrong?
And then there you are and it's getting better
Without you, I was lost forever

Singing from my heart, sad love song
Stranger from the start, what went wrong?
And then there you are and it's getting better
Without you, I was lost forever

When I met you, I was on my own
Twenty-two, living alone
Wasted on the cover of a magazine
Singing from my heart, sad love song
Stranger from the start, what went wrong?
And then there you are and it's getting better
Without you, I was lost forever

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh


Maybe someday I can show you
How much you mean to me
Even though I know you see
My smiling eyes begin to stream
A love wells up inside me
Almost too much to take
Sometimes I break down crying
That's how much you mean to me

You're the light in a heartbroken world
And I was a lost cause
Before you, I almost forgot
What the point was
In the end, if it's all just a dream
At least we're together
If I'm with you, I could stay lost forever

And if I were barely breathing
I'd still confess my love
Even when I see you clearly hope
I catch on quick and stop
If my zipped lips were sewn shut
Collar up, I'd keep it cool
The light in my heart beaming
Shining brighter than the sun

You're the light in a heartbroken world
And I was a lost cause
Before you, I almost forgot
What the point was
In the end, if it's all just a dream
At least we're together
If I'm with you, I could stay lost forever

There was a time before this
Back when we were young
I still remember how
You brought me back to life again
I looked in your blue-green eyes
You're looking back at me
My heart explodes in sunlight
You mean everything to me

You're the light in a heartbroken world
And I was a lost cause
Before you, I almost forgot
What the point was
In the end, if it's all just a dream
At least we're together
If I'm with you, I could stay lost forever

If I'm with you, I could stay lost forever
If I'm with you, I could stay lost forever


I was just a Jersey kid born in a daydream
Blue skies and a white gold sun down a long driveway
In an old white house, I remember my dad walk up
His eyes shining like clear blue streams
And when he smiled at me
I knew everything would be okay

Well, somehow (somehow), sometime (sometime)
I know it'll be all right, we are alive in the world

Back when you could see the Milky Way
In blue starlight, in an ocean sky
I could've laid there for a thousand years
Connecting dots in a ring of fire
Drawing circles that hang in the air
Like fireworks and diamond stars
In her mother's arms, her sapphire eyes
Was all the love I'd ever need

Well, somehow (somehow), sometime (sometime)
I know it'll be all right, we are alive in the world

Yeah, somehow (somehow), sometime (sometime)
I know it'll be all right, we are alive in the world
Alive in the world"

Mistaking advances of the natives
Who have come to lend a hand

Terror always seems to win
In the drama of human motivation
Where is restraint and reason?

Threat is urgent, existential
With patience wearing thin
But the danger's elemental
It's chaos from within

The fox-stained leaves of civilization
Depict a stark repeat
It's always a flaw in reasoning
That fates the citizenry
When the ancestor fell from the arbor
The march of fear began
But the predator wallowed in failure
In the face of consciousness

Threat is urgent, existential
Time to scan the horizon
But the danger's elemental

And I'm pretty sure we're just running on fumes
No one really cares about the route
Beaches break down and the waves retreat
Are we stuck in some perpetual repeat?
Maybe we're like massive cliffs of sand
Waiting for the plates to smash again

Downfall, gravity calls
Entropy makes fools of us all
Downfall, you can't forestall
It's proof there ain't no invisible hand

No one 'round here can contain their fears
So contented with false hope to soothe the tears
Faith is king while truth is on the lam
Disenfranchised scientists be damned

Downfall, gravity calls
Entropy makes fools of us all
Downfall, it's a natural law
And the judge don't have no use for the witness stand

Free will is your dilemma (What will the dust remember?)

Utopia is an opiated dream
What we want is an open society
One torn and frayed at the edges
With pages of imperfect changes

Free will is your dilemma (What will the dust remember?)

Of naked crimes against eternity

The new aristocracy just smells like the old regime

They think that they can alter and sway which version of freedom reigns
If everything is subjective then what good is truth anyway?
A plutocratic strategy or technocrat conspiracy
Or a vision of utopia that only the besotten can see?

Old regime, smoke of history

Is the enemy hiding in your conscience or can forgiveness pave the way?
There's got to be a place for them if tomorrow's a better day

With all the litter on the battlefields, no higher ground remains

Cut my teeth on a safety dance

Period pieces, congenital cheer
Faux evolution here
It's still 1992
Here in the bubble reminding you
At warped speed on the beltway loop
Bringing our giant too
Sour grapes and puke
Here in the past I repeat what they say
Here in the vault they instructed us to remain
We'll not fade away
Grateful for our home in our bubble
Throwback in the van
Cranking the oldies like Samiam
Jawbreaker, Mr. T Experience
Never rock anything new
Chesterfield Kings
I'll smoke a whole pack as I try to sing
Re-read The Stand by Stephen King
Avail satiates
Milk, milk, lemonade

We will stowaway
Grateful for the home in our bubble

Yeah!
Yeah, we get it
Heard it before, won't forget it
The house that we built, don't regret it
We've had our heyday
Beer for pay
The roach-ridden pads we were proud to stay
A dashboard of dusty demo tapes
Fucked up and stoked all day
Is there any other way?

Here in the vault where they locked us away
Incapable of change

When he unloaded his gun?
Does anyone know how loaded he was
When the slaughter had begun?

Does anyone think he did it because
He thought humans were in season?
His brain had a lesion?
Is it worse if he didn't have any reason?
Does anyone know what number of pints
He was planning to spill?
Does anyone think he may have just been prescribed
The wrong happy pill?
Which god told him to kill all the infidels?
The intellectuals, the homosexuals
Even the red-nexuals
Anything can start making sense
When it's imprinted out of context
Does anyone know what made him decide
To unload his first round?
Do you think he cared what race or faith
For the victims he left for dead on the ground?
Does anyone know how Jewish he was?
Does anyone know how Buddish he was?
Does anyone know how if he's a Christian?
Had a pot to piss in? Did he consider it a sin?
Did anyone go to church for the dead
And ask to kneel and pray?
How can you believe in a God
And still carry a card of the NRA?
I thought religion is supposed to instill
A notion that it's not right to kill
It must be a bitter pill
To admit that you're all mentally ill
Why do we have a harder time
When there's no enemy to blame?
It doesn't matter how many were killed
The debate is the same
Is it alright to hunt or judge you for fun?
Is it protection we need from the gun?
The blame is always placed on someone
It's always how the story is spun
Only a lunatic
Would sell a lunatic a gun"

Emptied for the art walk while the missions close
Pop-up tent cities abounding
Birthing scant displaced humanity
As we diversify
We spill from cities
Beyond the wealth crest
Traditional boundaries
Everything meant to burn. Thirty-year cycles
Mud pots, sandstone bluffs, crumble and erode
Fault lines, fortitude
Small streets swell into grand avenues
As we devalue
Debtors of the dream
Living oblivion
Skin-deep sun-seeking
Life in the construct that's sold
Promised land, golden state, sunny, blissful
No longer affordable

Just distant oceans and great blue skies

My  mundane mind is waiting on some kind of miracle

Maybe  it's for the better we both stay strangers forever
Maybe it's for the best we pretend like we never met
Forget  everything that we've ever known
Maybe it's for the better we both stay strangers forever
Strangers forever, strangers forever, strangers forever

Well I built a raft out of total desperation
And  I got kidnapped by a pirate nation
Now somewhere out there I ramble and roar
You wouldn't recognize me anymore
But if I come into your periphery
Please just act like you don't see me
Out here looking for a glimpse of shore
A mirage of the life that we had before

Maybe it's for the better we both stay strangers forever

Forget everything that we've ever known

Thought I heard your voice at the bar

I'm wishing on a burned out star

Unlike the opportunist
Victim aligned
Finally verified
We're still alive
Oh, to stamp out the meek
Our common enemy
Off with their heads
Off with their heads
Off with their heads
Our words are all the evidence we need
Off with their heads
Off with their heads
Off with their heads
With chosen marks we deviate, transformed
Off with their heads
Off with their heads
Off with their heads
As if these marks resemble those inborn"
Lagwagon,The Suffering,Railer,10/04/2019,"""The world is full of magical things, patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper
Those who have never known the deep intimacy and the intense companionship of happy mutual love have missed the best thing that life has to give
Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.""
All our lives in fast pursuit
Smash and grab like thieves
Posterity. What will you leave behind?
Consigned
Life, a humbling disease
Believe
Devoted road, the places you will go
All the people you will know
Crossroads
Resolve your actions and your deeds
Echo for eternity
Foresee
Want for contact, need for insight
The unbearable pity for the suffering
How do you express yourself?
How do you tell the truth?
Surrounding you, the darkest points of view
Suffer
In their toxic feedback loop
Hostage
Devoted road, the places I've travelled
All of the people I have known
High roads
Full of doubt and certain of nothing
Concede
How humbling my life has been
Begin
Want connection, hunt for knowledge
The unbearable lacking for the suffering
It's not unusual to lose hope
It's common to become unhinged
I'm giving in, I'm giving in
Let it begin. The suffering"
The Menzingers,Farewell Youth,Hello Exile,10/04/2019,"PA turnpike, northbound on a dark night
Driving into Scranton for a difficult occasion
When you first got your license we were nowhere to be found
I was just a little kid back then but you let me hang around
But we're older now

Farewell youth, I'm afraid I hardly got to know you
I was always hanging out with the older kids
Always in a rush, but I was never sure from what
I was always hanging out with the older kids

The grief starts when bumping into friends turned acquaintances
We stumble around the small talk
We break the silence with Jameson
But once we were inseparable
We were the only punks in town
We spent every weekend raisin' hell in the basement of your parents house
But we're older now

Farewell youth, I'm afraid I hardly got to know you
I was always hanging out with the older kids
Always in a rush, but I was never sure from what
I was always hanging out with the older kids

In someone's apartment, getting fucked up
To all our favorite records, drinking the cheap stuff
We couldn't get enough of growing up
I saw my childhood flash before me in the death of your closed eyes
At your Irish wake we celebrate by trying not to cry

Farewell youth, I'm afraid I hardly got to know you
I was always hanging out with the older kids
Always in a rush, but I was never sure from what
I was always hanging out with the older kids

Farewell youth
Farewell youth
Farewell youth, I'm afraid I hardly got to know you
Farewell youth
Farewell youth
Farewell youth, I'm afraid I hardly got to know you
Because I was always hanging out with the older kids"
The Menzingers,Hello Exile,Hello Exile,10/04/2019,"Her language was a perfect phrase
Her playful prose followed me for days
Down the alleyways of my desire
To their final resting place

In a vacation town where I lived year round
She migrated here with the summer crowds
And we fell in love under impossible smiles
Life was perfect if just for a little while

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile

And a thousand years may come and go
We may never meet another soul
Here on our own island of Elba in the Poconos
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile

And we bathed in the sun
Cut our jeans into shorts
Outstared every star in the sky
Under the cover of nowhere the present was a present
It looked beautiful on you every night

But we knew it would end yeah we knew it all along
It was a future never reconciled
It's as if letting your shackled heart feel loved was more difficult than total denial

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile

And a thousand years may come and go
I may never meet another soul
Here on my own island of Elba in the Poconos
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile

Now I imagined her memory would fade in the void
She'd only reappear every now and again
I'd smile at the thought of us
Go back to my day
But that was purely wishful thinking

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile

And a thousand years may come and go
I may never meet another soul
Here on my own island of Elba in the Poconos
And just play the last set of my mind
Our passions were real from the summertime
Swimming in the Delaware wringing out your long blonde hair
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hello exile"
The Menzingers,High School Friend,Hello Exile,10/04/2019,"Raisin' hell in Wayne County
With a copper on our tail
Hopin' that he drives on by me
But knowin' this town he'll probably throw us in jail

We're both so paranoid in our hometown
There's so much unclaimed baggage at the carousels
And though we're guilty of nothing we feel like fugitives running
Towards the Great White North or a border town in Mexico

There's former you, there's former me
We're tellin' tales of revisionist history
I remember the days we couldn't hardly wait to end

I was getting fucked up with a high school friend
Wonderin' where all the good times went
I was gettin' fucked up with a high school friend
Wonderin' where all the good times went

We left town the minute we turned 18
We moved to different corners of the country
Now we come back for holidays and funerals
So much has changed but Wayne County's still the same

Drivin' down 191
There's an old memory of someone
As a little white cross just popping out from the bend

I was getting fucked up with a high school friend
Wonderin' where all the good times went
I was gettin' fucked up with a high school friend
Wonderin' where all the good times went
(Oh oh oh oh oh)

Don't let the overwhelming sorrow shred all hopes of tomorrow
Don't let em tell you how to live your life
'Cause they may never understand but it's okay because I do
We know all the ups and downs each other have been through

I was getting fucked up with a high school friend
Wonderin' where all the good times went
I was gettin' fucked up with a high school friend
Wonderin' where all the good times went
(Oh oh oh oh oh)"
The Menzingers,I Can't Stop Drinking,Hello Exile,10/04/2019,"Champagne drunk, tomorrow is out of luck
When  the celebrations come to an end
When  the party's over, Sunday morning wakes up sober
Begs for me to start up again
I'm whiskey drunk in the Shop Rite parking lot
I'm  waiting while Anna buys milk and eggs
Sometimes  I wonder why she hasn't found another
One that her girlfriends would recommend

Our  worst fights are when we get silent
Just a disappointed you shaking your head
When the cards and flowers don't work
I sleep on the couch when I'm a jerk
What's  gotta give, what's gotta give

'Cause I know what you're thinking
That I can't stop drinking
Every time you try and ask me to
I just throw a fit and storm out of the room
'Cause I know what you're thinking

I'm cheap beer drunk in a bar off Passyunk
I'll be here until the lights come up again
Feel free to join me if you're bored or feeling lonely
I could sure use the company
I miss you so much when I was your drunk lush
You knew me so well, I knew you half as well
Love's a cruel, cruel joke when the tools in the shed can't fix what's broke
So you leave it broke

'Cause I know what you're thinking
That I can't stop drinking
Every time you try and ask me to
I just throw a fit and storm out of the room
'Cause I know what you're thinking"
The Menzingers,Last To Know,Hello Exile,10/04/2019,"Jesus Christ be damned
I held the dagger in my hand
I killed another man
Pictures carved in stone
See your reflection in your phone
And know we're not alone

Cemetery walls
Klonopin and alcohol
Tonight I won't start a fight
You barely made a sound
We put your mother in the ground
Some words are never found

Promises were made on an alter in blood
Sacrificial children's voices echo on and on
We're the last to know, we're the last to know

They told us who we are
In spiral ladders to the stars
Collect our memories
We'll be back again
Each time a little different
It ends where it begins

Promises were made on an alter in blood
Sacrificial children's voices echo on and on
We're the last to know, we're the last to know
The last to know"
The Menzingers,London Drugs,Hello Exile,10/04/2019,"What's it gonna take to fix me up?
I don't want your London drugs
Every time I'm with you I take too much
I don't want your London drugs
Every once in a while when I'm in denial
I wind up doing something I don't want to do
What's it gonna take to fix me up?
I don't want your London drugs

On a rainy night in Soho
The wind was whistling all its charms
I think we overstayed our welcome
They're giving us the look at the argyll arms
You happened to notice my anxious commotion
As my heart bled through my shirt
I've been a little heavy handed keepin' it at work

What's it gonna take to fix me up?
I don't want your London drugs
Every time I'm with you I take too much
I don't want your London drugs
Every once in a while when I'm in denial
I wind up doing something I don't want to do
What's it gonna take to fix me up?
I don't want your London drugs

My anxiety can sleep easy
The show was everything I hoped it would be
And now we're sitting in the back of the theater
Binging everything that's left to drink
'Cause in a moment it's over
The high and the thrill
Then I'm leaving here so unfulfilled
Well if I don't change now I never will

What's it gonna take to fix me up?
I don't want your London drugs
Every time I'm with you I take too much
I don't want your London drugs
Every once in a while when I'm in denial
I wind up doing something I don't want to do
What's it gonna take to fix me up?
I don't want your London drugs

What's it gonna take to fix me up?
I don't want your London drugs
'Cause every time I'm with you I take too much
I don't want your London drugs
What's it gonna take to fix me up?
I don't want your London drugs"
The Menzingers,Portland,Hello Exile,10/04/2019,"We're two strings shaking in a minor chord
We're survivors of life but we're prisoners of war
It was recklessness, what we came here for
Started on the bed ended up on the floor
We're two strings shaking in a minor chord
Oh Allison I love you, but I can't change the past

Bring the part of me you love back
Bring the part of me you love back
The part of me you love back
Bring the part of me you love back
The part of me you love back

You wake up shaking in the middle of the night
A voice from the past back looking for a fight
Seize your sorrow, breathe with me
The pause between is all we need
They say it hurts til it doesn't
You said ""the future is unwritten, let the past stay in the past""

Bring the part of me you love back
Bring the part of me you love back
The part of me you love back
Bring the part of me you love back
The part of me you love back
(Cheap champagne and roses
I know one day you'll notice)
Bring the part of me you love back
Bring the part of me you love back
The part of me you love back
Bring the part of me you love back
The part of me you love back"
The Menzingers,Strain Your Memory,Hello Exile,10/04/2019,"May the highways cross their fingers and hope
That we may one day find ourselves home
She sticks her head outside the passenger window
Sighs as traffic stops and goes
It's been two weeks now living in this southern town
We hoped the change would change our restless minds
A little rewind to a simpler time
I swear it's temporary living in this cheap motel
Somewhere in the bible belt
We made love at that Marietta Motel 6
You fell asleep on my shoulder of commitment
Took it as a sign everything would be fine
Sometimes it takes these kind of nights just to realize
How we want to spend the rest of our lives

Could a diamond in the rough ever be enough
I've been mining for your love
Since the day that we met I've spent every second in your minefield digging it up
Can you strain your memory back to the times
When trouble wasn't always, always on our minds
Trouble wasn't always on our minds
Back to the times when trouble wasn't always on our minds

And now the hotel maids were bangin' down the door
As if they came looking for some answers
When ya gonna leave? Where ya gonna go?
Will you get your shit together?
When are you gonna marry her?
Well maybe you don't deserve her
Maybe the whole thing was doomed from the start
This inquisition is tearing me apart

Could a diamond in the rough ever be enough
I've been mining for your love
Since the day that we met I've spent every second in your minefield digging it up
Can you strain your memory back to the times
When trouble wasn't always on our minds
Can you strain your memory one more time
When trouble wasn't always, always on our minds
When trouble wasn't always on our minds
Back to the times when trouble wasn't always on our minds"
The Menzingers,Strawberry Mansion,Hello Exile,10/04/2019,"Hurtling toward the earth
Set the atmosphere on fire
We'll put another notch in the Kuiper
Climb down from the trees to die from a disease
Brought back from the dead by the liars

I don't mind, I'll stay behind

Transmission in static, the silent monastic
Exiled to an island of plastic
Waiting on translation, the fool's coronation
A permanent summer vacation

I don't mind, I'll stay behind

Set a course for the sun
To bittersweet oblivion
The time has come, the rain has gone
Back to hell where we belong

The games we've been playing
The real estate is changing
The mountains and rivers to lake beds
Concrete to dust
Iron to rusted statues reign over the ocean

I don't mind, I'll stay behind

Set a course for the sun
To bittersweet oblivion
The time has come, the rain has gone
Back to hell where we belong

Set a course for the sun
To bittersweet oblivion
The time has come, the rain has gone
Back to hell where we belong"
A Day to Remember,Resentment,You're Welcome,11/22/2019,"Resentment

I need a short term fix for a long term problem
Can I learn to love these chains?
I know I had a point but now I forgot it
While I'm circlin' the drain

No, I can't stop feelin' like every day's exactly the same
With a one track mind I don't think I can change
Trapped in memories stuck on replay, replay, replay

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high-wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up
Resentment

You know I lost my voice when I let the rot in
Hard truth cuts both ways
Pourin' out my heart
All that's unforgiven
Washing over me like rain

No, I can't stop feeling like every day's exactly the same
With a one track mind I don't think I can change
Trapped in memories stuck on replay, replay, replay

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high-wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up
Resentment

I've got this chip on my shoulder
So I press the issues on sight
For all who need introduction
Welcome to the eye of the tiger
Go

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high-wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up
Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high-wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up

It's a wildfire
It's a wildfire
Resentment
It's a wildfire
It's a wildfire
Resentment"
