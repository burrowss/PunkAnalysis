A Day to Remember,1958,And Their Name Was Treason,2005-05-10,"And shepherds we shall be
For thee my lord for thee
Power hath descended forth from thy hand
That our feet may swiftly carry out thy command
So we shall flow river forth to thee
And teeming with souls shall it ever be
In nomine patris
Et filli
Et spiritus sancti

You've sunk lower than I've ever seen
And even though you deserved this
I tried to catch your fall
I've grown so tired of your childish threats
Know that I'll never run from anything

And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive

Here's where we prove all your fairytales wrong
This all stops tonight
Swim in your sea of smoke
Until your lungs lose the fight
It's over
This all stops tonight
Or prove me wrong

What have you become through your jealousy?
You've threatened my life, my friends and family
This is your last wrong turn in your life
And this dead end leads to a blood bath
Your blood bath

And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive

Here's where we prove all your fairytales wrong
This all stops tonight
Swim in your sea of smoke
Until your lungs lose the fight
It's over
This all stops tonight
Or prove me wrong

You'll never stop us with your one-man army
We would burn him alive
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
If you're such a man then bring the fight
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
We would burn him alive
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
If you're such a man then bring the fight

This is me calling you out
You want to talk like a man, then be a man
Stop talking like you're something (We're paging 1958)
You always have so much to say but it's never to our faces
I'm right here (We're paging 1958)
We're all one and the same
We're moving on, and living our dreams (We're paging 1958)
We're all one and the same
We're moving on, and living our dreams (We're paging 1958)"
A Day to Remember,2nd Sucks,What Separates Me From You,2010-11-11,"FIGHT!

You're afraid, like I make my deals with the devil
You've been at it for years, but couldn't reach that next level
Let's keep it real, this is no competition to me
Even if everyone around you acts like they don't see

(Oh!) Is anybody else listening? Outta sight outta mind is what you'll always be
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest. I laid my life on the line so I expect nothing less from you

I speak the truth and everybody else knows it
So set your ego to the side and just get the fuck over it
Can't waste my time on hateful people like you
So keep wishing you were me and I'll keep making you have to

(Oh!) Is anybody else listening? Outta sight outta mind is what you'll always be
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest. I laid my life on the line so I expect nothing less from you

I just can't believe it's really come to this
Because without me, you would not exist

(Hey, hey!)
Still got something left to say
Only one in the world that I depend on is me
I need nothing from no one, I take what I need
Get a hold of yourself, and keep away from me

(Oh!) Is anybody else listening? Outta sight outta mind is what you'll always be
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest. I laid my life on the line so I expect nothing less from you"
A Day to Remember,All I Want,What Separates Me From You,2010-11-15,"I'm always screaming my lungs out 'til my head starts spinning
Playing my songs is the way I cope with life
Won't keep my voice down
Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud
I like to keep things honest
I'm a safe bet like your life's staked on it, for real
I'd hate to keep you all wondering
I'm constant like the seasons
And I will never be forgotten man

Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
Keep your hopes up high and your head down low

Still got something left to prove
It tends to keep things movin' while everyone around me says
My last days are looming overhead
But just what the hell do they think they know?
I keep my head above the water, while they drown in the undertow

Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low

If you take it from me, live your life for yourself
Cause when it's all said and done, you don't need anyone else
C'mon!

So let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
Not a worry in the world, tell me was this all worth it?
I get what I want so everyone's always judging me
I'm not afraid of anything, I've got the whole world in front of me

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your hopes up high, and your head down low

Keep your heads down low, keep your heads down low
Keep your hopes up high, and your heads down low"
A Day to Remember,All Signs Point to Lauderdale,What Separates Me From You,2010-11-15,"I hate this town, it's so washed up, And all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck When will I find where I fit in?
2, 3, 4

Remember when I tried, I never strayed too far from you
Forever by your side, No matter what I was going through
But now I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me, guess, I was always wrong

I hate this town, it's so washed up, and all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck, When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town

Cause no one can understand, I just can't be tied down
Nothing comes between me and my plans
So now I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me, Guess, I was always wrong

I hate this town, it's so washed up, and all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck, When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town

And don't believe a word they're telling to you
Don't believe a word they're telling to you
They let me down, when will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town

My world cannot ever bring me down
Gave everything I had to turn it back around
Cause our time's worth something, Bigger than both you and me
I can't live my life always backing down
I gotta do this right, then they can't make a sound
Cause I'm not here for nothing, Least I can say I stand for something
(You and me, we stand for something)

I hate this town, it's so washed up, and all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck, When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town

And don't believe a word they're telling to you
Don't believe a word they're telling to you
They let me down
When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town"
A Day to Remember,Another Song About the Weekend,Homesick,2009-02-03,"They keep playing sad songs on the radio
And I feel like I'm so alone
On this 15-hour drive
And all the while I tell myself to just believe
Cause nobody can give so much
And never get anything
(never get anything)

Everyone I used to know
Says they don't know what I've become
But I'm still the same
Not much has changed
I still know where I came from

I fell asleep with the lights on
And I can see that you're the first one in a long time
That had some faith in me (have faith in me)
Tell my friends we won't be long
The Florida sun begs me to come back home
And it feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me

And all the while I say too much of what I think
And I can't remember what it's like to find meaning in anything
For the life of me

Everyone I used to know
Says they don't know what I've become
But I'm still the same
Not much has changed
I still know where I came from
And all I ever wanted was so far from what I need
I'll write my songs, they'll sing along, and hope time heals everything

I fell asleep with the lights on
And I can see that you're the first one in a long time
That had some faith in me (have faith in me)
Tell my friends we won't be long
The Florida sun begs me to come back home
And it feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me

This is all I have!
This is all I have!
It's my life
This is all I have!
This is all I have!

I fell asleep with the lights on
And I can see that you're the first one in a long time
That had some faith in me (have faith in me)
Tell my friends we won't be long
The Florida sun begs me to come back home
And it feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me"
A Day to Remember,Bad Vibrations,Bad Vibrations,2016-06-02,"Don't forget that this is a choice
Pick your poison
Live with remorse
Don't forget that this is a choice
Pick your poison
Live with remorse

I could burn a hole with my eyes that cuts straight through the skin
No more love, no more resolution
It's getting harder bearing the darkness within
I gotta let it out
I'm gonna let it

I can feel your bad vibrations
All around me
All consuming
Corrupting all that I am
This pain is a sickness looming over me, and I can't escape it
Casting shadows that continue to shape who I am on any given day

It's like a fog surrounds me applying pressure within
Weighing me down, seeing in double vision
It hits so hard I stu- stu- stutter my speech
Ya go kinda cold inside
Dancing on thin ice

I can feel your bad vibrations
All around me
All consuming
Corrupting all that I am
This pain is a sickness looming over me, and I can't escape it
Casting shadows that continue to shape who I am on any given day
This pain is a sickness looming over me, and I can't escape it
Casting shadows that continue to shape who I am on any given day
Toxic
Toxic
Toxic
Toxic

This darkness, this darkness
Leaves me empty like
I am the heartless
Toxic
Toxic within"
A Day to Remember,Best Of Me,Common Courtesy,2013-10-08,"What'd you expect from me?
It's not my fault you'll never be happy
Just 'cause you're right doesn't mean I'm wrong
Our days were numbered and we knew it all along
Can't you let things be?
Now all that's left is misunderstandings
Spent my nights wishing I was gone
My dad was right, we will never get along

So I'm done, 'cause things could never be the same
This is the last time, this is the last time you'll ever burden me

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
Stretched myself out way too far
Now I can see you for who you are
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
It's all finally making sense
You took what's left of my innocence
Oh no
I can't believe you got the best of me

Can't you act your age?
Is it that hard to say what you're thinking?
Lately my life's moving way too fast
You'd drag me down if I'd let you hold me back
What a mess you've made
And you hide from it at the bars you frequent
Blamed myself avoiding time this cost
But looking back you only learn from what you lost

So I'm done, 'cause things could never be the same
This is the last time, this is the last time you'll ever burden me

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
Stretched myself out way too far
Now I can see you for who you are
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
It's all finally making sense
You took what's left of my innocence
Oh no
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe you got the best of me

I will never be the one you want, no I will never be the one you want
Finally come to terms that I can't stop, no not this time. (Ye-yeah)
I will never be the one you want, no I will never be the one you want
Finally come to terms that I can't stop, no not this time

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
Stretched myself out way too far
Now I can see you for who you are
I can't believe you got the best of me

A Day to Remember,Better Off This Way,What Separates Me From You,2010-11-15,"I wonder if you’ll notice, If they lock me up and throw away the key
Try to be open minded, you’ve got a lot to learn in the ways of me
You always got to say something
I’m none of your concern but you won't listen at all
You know I’d rather say nothing
And just be proud of myself for tearing down these walls

When you fall I’ll be the only one who looks away
When you call I’ll be the first to tell you I can’t stay
It’s all over, I found a better way to help keep you from me
I’m better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh
I'm better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh

You gotta keep this coming
Tell it like you know it but you don’t know nothing
Your call, we can settle this like gentlemen
Or meet me out the back to end it all and start again
My whole life’s spent waiting
Ever since I can remember been anticipating your fall
And God let it be a long one
Can’t let go of my grudge till I know you’re done

When you fall I’ll be the only one who looks away
When you call I’ll be the first to tell you I can’t stay
It’s all over, I found a better way to help keep you from me
I’m better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh
I'm better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh

You want it, you’ve got it
You’ve always been such a waste of time
You want it, you’ve got it
A friend of yours is no friend of mine
You want it, you’ve got it
When will you act your age
You want it, you’ve got it
You’re the reason things have to change

Woah-oh, woah-oh
You’re the reason things have to change
Woah-oh, woah-oh

When you fall I’ll be the only one who looks away
When you call I’ll be the first to tell you I can’t stay
It’s all over, I found a better way to help keep you from me
I’m better off this way
Woah-oh, woah-oh
I’m better off this way
Woah-oh, woah-oh
I’m better off this way"
A Day to Remember,Bullfight,Bad Vibrations,2016-07-23,"What a waste, I see you now and then
But mostly we pretend we're not more strangers than we're friends
Then we say, what we need to say, to try and get away from the tension we create

Why can't we say the things, the things we wish we would?
Why can't we laugh the way, the way we know we should?
Fall under the weight of all the pressure that's misplaced
Flaws that I embrace

Everybody sees your head’s hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness
Everybody sees your head’s hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness

I get
I get
I get so misunderstood

Something changed the way we interact
Now we can't get it back
Another relic of the past (Relic of the past)
Makes you think, did I ever know you at all?
Follow until I fall
Vultures circling in the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun

Why can't we say the things, the things we wish we would?
Why can't we laugh the way, the way we know we should?
Fall under the weight of all the pressure that's misplaced
Flaws that I embrace

Everybody sees your head’s hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness
Everybody sees your head’s hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness

I get
I get
I get so misunderstood

You can't just avoid the issue
You should've learned from the things we've been through
You don't know what you have until it’s lost
Till the hammer drops
Brace, fall
Brace, fall
Brace, fall
Brace, fall
Brace, fall
Brace, fall
Brace, fall
Brace, fall

Fall under the weight of all the pressure that's misplaced
Flaws that I embrace

Everybody sees your head’s hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness
Everybody sees your head’s hung low

A Day to Remember,City of Ocala,Common Courtesy,2013-10-08,"Fuck yeah!

Remember way back when? They said this life was a dream
Well it still is, I never wanna wake
Standing in my backyard at our old practice space
Hard to hold back the tears from streaming down my face

That was then, this is now
You can't run before you go learn how, and you won't

This is our corner of the world
Where we can come to be ignored
This is our point where we return
This is where I came from
This is where I came from

Remember way back when? This place seemed bigger to me
Learned how to play guitar, and made my mom watch me
We always knew back then, just where I'd be right now
We never questioned it, was more like when and how

That was then, this is now
You can't run before you go learn how, and you won't

This is our corner of the world
Where we can come to be ignored
This is our point where we return
This is where I came from
This is what made us who we became
Where they know me, not just my name
There's not another place the same
This is where I came from
This is where I came from
Yeah!

You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us
Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough
Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around
You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us
Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough
Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around

Oh oh oh, this is where I came from, I'm right back at it again
Oh oh oh, this is where I came from
Oh oh oh, this is where I came from, I'm right back at it again
Oh oh oh, this is where I came from

This is what made us who we became
Where they know me, not just my name

A Day to Remember,Degenerates,You’re Welcome,2019-08-20,"My friends are degenerates
But I'd never change them
Liars, cheats, and hypocrites
Not the type for savin'

Why do we tend to hurt one another?
Dividin' up all the books by the covers
Like it ain't hard enough simply bein' me
(Like it ain't hard enough simply bein' me)
Or could I sum you up just by what I see?

In reality, everyone's a lot more complicated

My friends are degenerates
But I'd never change them
Liars, cheats, and hypocrites
Not the type for savin'

Or so they say

I get that look more than I remember
Turnin' your nose up while we're at dinner
Like how can he afford somethin' that I want?
(Like how can he afford somethin' that I want?)
Sold all your empathy, tell me what it cost
(Sold all your empathy, tell me what it cost)

Character is who you are when no one's watchin'

My friends are degenerates
But I'd never change them
Liars, cheats, and hypocrites
Not the type for savin'

Or so they say

Like a moment of truth that you try to omit
Consequences retained for the judgement ya give
When you finally find you're the degenerate
It's gonna hit like a brick!

Like it ain't hard enough simply bein' me
Or could I sum you up just by what I see?

Is this where you wanna be?
Exhumed they're not through with you until you're left exposed
Is this who you wanna be?

Take what's been given or have none
The only claim of the workers in song
Get back in line you've all been warned
""We was beat when we was born""

Wish I would, but I never could

A Day to Remember,Heartless,And Their Name Was Treason,2005-01-22,"For once my eyes are open to you, and everything you've said

Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on
Cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart
I've been around the world and back for you, and now it's time to choose

I've been swallowed by this wreck that you call your life
I'm damaged from the inside. I've been broken

If you could read my mind you'd be in tears

I'm sick of your excuses you hold above me
I've finally come to terms with what I am
I'm nothing in your eyes, and this will not change
I'm living in a dream

Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on
Cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart
I've been around the world and back for you, and now it's time to choose

And I'll close my eyes, and dream of a better time
When I'll be finally past this and I'll be happy on my own
I've done all I can, and I've still been cast aside
All I ever wanted to be was be the one who would wipe tears from your eyes
But I guess I'll play second best, to a world that will never care about you
You'll never understand you're just another pretty face
You'll tell me that you care, and then run straight back to him
I can hear your voice of treason from a mile away

You never did know how to whisper

You're such a liar. Tell me the truth
You're such a liar. Tell me the truth
You're such a liar. Tell me the truth
Do the world a favor, stop cutting your arms, and slit your throat"
A Day to Remember,Homesick,Homesick,2009-02-03,"Everything around me seems so much different than where I'm from
And at this rate I think my fate's been sealed
This life's so unpredictable
We'll go continue to live a life that no one knows
Where's this gonna go?

Right here, right now
This is the beginning of the end
And I won't sing one single thing until we can get this right
I'm moving on
I'm moving on

Hey mom, I wrote you some soft songs
And tell dad I'm just fine
We had to choose
We made our moves
And now we got to go, go

Everything about me seemed so much different when I was young
I couldn't wait to take my place
Five years have passed
Good god have I been gone?
So why, I've never felt so alone in my whole life
Time's not on my side

Why does everything go wrong?
Why's this make me so nervous?
Why does everything go wrong?

I'm holding on to a fairy tale
We're moving forward but we're not there yet

I hope you're good tonight

A Day to Remember,I’m Already Gone,Common Courtesy,2013-10-08,"As I look 'round this makeshift moving house

On every side of town
That I've been through, that I know
To find my reason to come back home

I've worked it out, you'll always bring me down
From here on out, I'm doing things for me
Impatient now, I'm not the type for life alone
I need someone

I push back harder to clear the way
There's not a thing that I regret
Can't live my life in yesterday

A Day to Remember,In Florida,Bad Vibrations,2016-09-02,"December ain't cold at all this year in Florida
But I'm still chilled to the bone
The mind plays tricks this time of year in Florida
It's not the time to be alone

I feel the less you love the less you feel alive
I feel to understand it starts from the inside
And I feel that patience is a lesson learned in time
To be good with your own life's to be good with mine

Time stands still this time of year in Florida
The only time I feel at home
The neighborhood kids run down the road in Florida
It's got me scared I missed the boat

I feel the less you love the less you feel alive
I feel to understand it starts from the inside
And I feel that patience is a lesson learned in time
To be good with your own life's to be good with mine
To be good with your own life's to be good with mine

I always knew that I would leave
But I didn't think it'd change a part of me
Can't get back to who I was back then (who I was back then)
Feels wrong to shut that out
Seems wrong to pretend
To pretend

I feel the less you love the less you feel alive
I feel to understand it starts from the inside
And I feel that patience is a lesson learned in time
To be good with your own life's to be good with mine
To be good with your own life's to be good with mine"
A Day to Remember,I Remember,Common Courtesy,2013-10-08,"I'd never wish any of this on anyone or anything
Aw come on, you gotta try and look at things like me
I never needed anything I got
I never keep anything I have, what do I have?
Mostly things that'll never last
Then I think back...

I remember when I first saw the country
I remember sleeping in the van
Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand
I remember jumping off of cliff tops
I remember playing with no one there
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been
Cause where I've been

They wonder why I hide myself from everyone
From everything, man come on
You wouldn't last a day as me
Everyone loves me for my past, but they always hate me in the present
Why can't you just meet me somewhere in the middle?
It's in the hardest times we grow the most

I remember when I first saw the country
I remember sleeping in the van
Said goodbye to friends and family cause they could never understand
I remember jumping off of cliff tops
I remember playing with no one there
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am cause where I've been
Cause where I've been

Speeding up, to slow down
Side glances around this crowd all at me
There must be something I can't see, so tell me
Hold me up, help me out
As I circle around what makes me happy
There isn't one place that I can be without leaving
This is my life

I remember when I first saw the country
I remember sleeping in the van
Said goodbye to friends and family, cause they could never understand
They don't understand
They don't understand

I remember jumping off of cliff tops
I remember playing with no one there
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I am
I remember the coast of California
I remember trucks stops cross the land
Never kept too many idols cause we were busy being them
I remember waking up in Georgia. I remember quitting my last job
Yeah I knew if I became successful it wouldn't change who I was, where I've been
Cause where I've been"

I just hold it in, no matter how I've been

A Day to Remember,Life Lessons Learned The Hard Way,Common Courtesy,2013-10-08,"Life lessons learned the hard way

Four people waited in a random white unmarked van
Parked outside your hotel high rise garage
To use a tire iron to break the bones inside your legs
Too bad you never came outside, that's all right
Cause in the end you'll get wrecked
Yeah, in the end, you'll get wrecked

I heard a little girl killed herself today
That blood's on your hands (It's on your hands)
When everyone knows your face, nothing's safe
You'll live your life as a fucking target

In a van, on a soapbox for the world to see

Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them

We're getting older
I've started to fear for my life
Is this the way that it should be?
This whole thing's riding on me
It's been a long road so far
With nowhere to turn
There's no looking back from here
No more dwelling on my fears

I'll be there when you close your eyes at night
I'm always watching you

The doctor says I'm headed for destruction
My time is wearing thin...

I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, about it, about it
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, about it, about it
I'm still in your head"
A Day to Remember,Reassemble,Bad Vibrations,2016-09-02,"I have come undone
Desperate and out of touch
Fall when I should run
Am I worth a reassemble?
I have come undone
This illness is my crutch
Call out to anyone
Am I worth a reassemble?
I toss, turn beneath the waves
A silent victim of the depths
Cast aside I'm scrambling to catch my...
I can't find my way out as I'm descending
My path remains unclear as the water overtakes me
Drowning in my despair
I have come undone
Desperate and out of touch
Fall when I should run
Am I worth a reassemble?
I have come undone
This illness is my crutch
Call out to anyone
Am I worth a reassemble?
My thoughts are not my own
No where's safe alone in the tide
I'm alone and it sinks in
This current's pulling me under
Drowning in my despair
I have come undone
Desperate and out of touch
Fall when I should run
Am I worth a reassemble?
I have come undone
This illness is my crutch
Call out to anyone
Am I worth a reassemble?
The surf's against us
Are we able?
Forgive our faults when they're shameful
Let's be honest with ourselves
Worn and broken, reassembled
Forgive our thoughts when they're shameful
Let's be honest with ourselves, let's be honest with ourselves"
A Day to Remember,Resentment,You’re Welcome,2019-11-22,"Resentment

I need a short term fix for a long term problem
Can I learn to love these chains?
I know I had a point but now I forgot it
While I'm circlin' the drain

No, I can't stop feelin' like every day's exactly the same
With a one track mind I don't think I can change
Trapped in memories stuck on replay, replay, replay

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high-wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up
Resentment

You know I lost my voice when I let the rot in
Hard truth cuts both ways
Pourin' out my heart
All that's unforgiven
Washing over me like rain

No, I can't stop feeling like every day's exactly the same
With a one track mind I don't think I can change
Trapped in memories stuck on replay, replay, replay

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high-wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up

I've got this chip on my shoulder
So I press the issues on sight
For all who need introduction
Welcome to the eye of the tiger
Go

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high-wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up
Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up

A dance with demons on a high-wire
Lift me up

A Day to Remember,Right Back at it Again,Common Courtesy,2013-10-08,"We’re﻿ coming out swinging!

Started out in the spring of 2003
Never went to school, nobody talked to me
Except to tell me all the things I couldn’t do
Don’t want to hear about it
Got with my guys packed into all our cars
Hit all the nearest scenes, and every local bar
I played a show a night 'till it made me sick

So here I am, I’m right back at it again
Just like I’ve always said, if you're too cool for school
You ain’t here to make no friends
And﻿ I said hey (hey)
I’m right back at it again
Just like I have always said, you’re too cool for school
I ain’t here to make no friends

Left home with no kinda backup plan
And everyone one that we knew that we couldn’t stand
Said ""If you can’t﻿ make it here, you won’t make it there""
Don’t want to hear about it
Spent most of our nights sleeping on hardwood floors
People's living rooms, in any open door
Played a show at night 'till it all made sense

Don't wanna hear about it
Don't wanna hear about it, yeah

So here I am, I’m right back at it again
Just like I’ve always said, if you're too cool for school
You ain’t here to make no friends
And I said hey!
I’m right back at it again
Just like you’ll always say, you’re too cool for school
I ain’t﻿ here to make no...
Brace for impact

Don't wanna hear about it
Don't wanna hear about it
Bitch...

Something is so off!
Can we leave it this time?
What did you think?
I thought it was awesome. Leave the 'bitch' please?
You like the 'bitch?'
I've liked the 'bitch' since fucking Homesick"
A Day to Remember,Same About You,Bad Vibrations,2016-09-02,"I just felt a wave, an emotion
And right then I knew that everything had changed
A whole side of you that went missing’s gone
And all I'd thought of you is wrong
Gotta step away for perspective
Need to take a chance to clear my head
Don't wanna understand your position
Oughta wash my hands of you and run
Think I lost my nerve, like I lost you
Held trapped by what we were
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
Spent time today reminiscing
Think I learned a lot about who we are
Couldn't diagnose your condition
But now I see the signs you left behind
Think I lost my nerve, like I lost you
And the truth remains unheard
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
Some roads you can't come back from when you extract truth from the lie
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you"
A Day to Remember,Same Book But Never The Same Page,Common Courtesy,2013-10-08,"I've lost a part of me
'Cause I am just an open book for everyone to see
I always leave empty handed; I can't keep the things that mean the most to me
I'm walking steady on a tightrope clinging only to the words that I wrote
I might be temporarily blind but I'm not stupid

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face? (I've always wanted to know)
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place. (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it. I don't get it. Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down

I'd give you everything but that would never be good enough and that's alright with me
You take me for granted. I tried to help you be who you wanna be
I'm a sucker for a complication
Here goes another week it must seem
You weren't worth my time, you weren't worth my time
I still let you take it from me

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face? (I've always wanted to know)
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place. (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it. I don't get it. Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down

Why do I always do this to myself?
Always depending on everyone else
You know it's going to drive me crazy
You're just a notch in the wall that made me
(You're just a notch in the wall that made me)

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face? (I've always wanted to know)
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place. (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it. I don't get it. Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down

You always build me up to break me down
I said you'll always build me up to break me down
You break me down!
You break me down!
We never met on middle ground!
You break me..."
A Day to Remember,"Sometimes You’re The Hammer, Sometimes You’re The Nail",Common Courtesy,2013-10-08,"Start it
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling
Yo, I got it!

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling
Go get carried away

Go!

And the fears sets in, in an instant
Too much of myself gets exposed
This is where I go at my weakest
When I don't have to be scared to tell the truth

Tend to do my best when everything goes wrong
That's why sad songs make me happy, cause I don't have to feel alone

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling
No, you've got me wrong
Oh, the nights are long with no one else around
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Go get carried away

It's never what you've done, it's what you've done lately
Who cares what you're saying, if no ones listening
You don't have to like me, but you're gonna respect me
I that came from nothing, leave hope in my wake

I got no regrets, but have my days with doubt
To those left in sadness I'll be the one to lead you out

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I'm stumbling
No, you've got me wrong
Oh, the nights are long with no one else around
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Go get carried away

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable
Reserve my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgment
You don't make me who I am
I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable
Reserve my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgment
You don't make me who I am

God help those who help themselves
And forget about everyone else
You lost your nerve, you missed the point
God help those with open hands
May they never feel burdened again
Yeah, I'll stand up for those who can't
I'll close the distance"
A Day to Remember,Sticks & Bricks,What Separates Me From You,2010-11-15,"I am fueled by all forms of failure
I paid the price, so I'll take what's mine
Oh I bet ya didn't see that one coming
Cause I do as I please, and apologize for nothing
My time is flying, but I'm still second to none
Always shining the brightest when I'm placed under the gun (God damn)
So here I stand
The only son of a working-class man
I won't be held back
I can't be held down
Where were you when my walls came falling down? (They came falling down)
You tried to hide, you stood close by, and didn't make a sound
Say something
Find you some paper, and I'll go grab you a pen
You can start taking notes on how this all started again
Been dead last, but found my way to the front
With my inspirational quotes on why I never gave up
Where were you when my walls came falling down? (They came falling down)
You tried to hide, you stood close by, and didn't make a sound
Where were you when it all came back around? (It goes back around)
The reasons why you passed me by will always hold you down
Say something
If you can't stand the pressure
Stay the fuck out of my way
I know my place
This one goes out to everyone who's lied to my face
My heart is filled with hate
I'm making a difference
I'm taking a chance (A chance)
You can say what you want about me
But no one can tell me I can't
Where were you when my walls came falling down? (They came falling down)
You tried to hide, you stood close by, and didn't make a sound
Where were you when it all came back around? (It goes back around)

Be careful, get your lawyers, 'cause you're gonna get sued!""

You're all about you, and it's my fast track to an early grave

Why can't you just do what's right by me?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out

Hope it's seen beyond these walls you're suffocating me

Why can't you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home
Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight

How's living a lie?
You never could face me
And you hide behind fake personalities
Because deep down you're scared
So weak beyond compare

I gotta get out, I gotta get out
Why can't we just go our separate ways?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out
It won't be much farther, I'm counting the days

The room it keeps spinning faster, I'm drifting off to sleep
Hope it's seen beyond these walls you're suffocating me

I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home
Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight

My friends still stand behind me
We stuck together through all we lost
Even when your worst surrounds me, you'll never get the best of us

Now go tell them we sold out, like we're the ones who changed

So unhappy for so long
Where did I go wrong?
I've got to get out of this
My hand is on the handle
We're leaving everything behind
Goodbye for a lifetime

I'll rip that scandalous bitch in two
We'll bring the noise

Try to pretend that I never even knew your name
Cause everything you are disgusts me

So I wouldn't be here
What I'd give for you to disappear
So tell me girly how's your edge?

We're a force that can shake the whole world
For once we're doing something right when we say, (Whoa, whoa)

In the end it's not about what you have
In the end, it's all about where you want to go
And the roads you take to help you get there
I hope you think that's fair
Cause you've only got one life to lead
So don't take for granted those little things
Those little things are all that we have

Forget everything just for tonight

I miss your family and I miss all our friends

Cause I would, this meant something more to me
There's a hole in my heart where you used to be

I still wish you the best of luck, baby
And don't go thinking this was a waste of time
I couldn't forget you if I tried

You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I’ll live with regret for my whole life

I confess that I brought this all on myself
Condemned to suffer alone, like there's nobody else
When you're gone, it's like a whole part of me’s missing
So I'll keep living the lie and just hope that you're listening
I tried to make us a life here
But our foundation was built on sand
No time to run until the damage was done
And I’ve never had the upper hand

I still wish you the best of luck, baby
And don't go thinking this was a waste of time
I couldn't forget you if I tried

You killed what was left of the good in me

Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I’ll live with regret for my whole life

All the things you love are all the things I hate
How did we get here in the first place?

I play it cool but it's hard to be (All my trust)
Is slowly burning inside of me (Over what)
There can't be anymore progress, I know our fate
The only thing that can heal this is time and space

You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried

None of that ever seems to matter when I'm holding you

And I'm wasting away, away from you
And I'm wasting away, away from you

What have I gotten into this time around
I know that I had sworn I'd never trust
Anyone again but I didn't have to
You had me at hello

I've never seen a smile that can light the room like yours
It's simply radiant, I see it more with every day that goes by
I watch the clock to make my timing just right
Would it be okay?
Would it be okay if I took your breath away?

And I'm wasting away, away from you
And I'm wasting away, away from you

What have I gotten into this time around

A Day to Remember,You Should’ve Killed Me When You Had The Chance,And Their Name Was Treason,2005-05-10,"So I say goodbye to a town that has ears and eyes
I can hear you whispering as I walk by
Familiar faces smiling back at me and I knew
This would make them change

The only thing that's going to bother me
Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends
Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?

The writings on the wall, you've read that I'll be gone, but if you call my name
Just know that I'll come running, for one more night to spare with you
This is where I'm meant to be, please don't leave me

I've read these stories a thousand times, and now I'll rewrite them all
You're meddling in an anger you can't control
She means the world to me, so hold your serpent tongue
Is a whores lies worth dying for? Trust me, I'm done

The only thing that's going to bother me
Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends
Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?

The writings on the wall, you've read that I'll be gone, but if you call my name
Just know that I'll come running, for one more night to spare with you
This is where I'm meant to be, please don't leave me

I walked into your house this morning
I brought the gun from our end table
Your blood was strewn across the walls
They'll find you on your bathroom floor
I walked into your house this morning
I brought the gun from our end table
Your blood was strewn across the walls
They'll find you on your bathroom floor when I'm done
But should I write it all off?

But should I write it all off?
But should I write it all off?
But should I write it all off?

But should I... ?

The Menzingers,After the Party,After the Party,2017-01-09,"It's the little things my mind commits
To etch behind my eyelids
Like getting stoned when we wake up
Coffee grounds and coffee cups
Your silhouette in high top sneakers
And hardcore from laptop speakers
The classics to the more obscure
From Minor Threat to your old roommate's band

Like a kaleidoscope in vibrant hues
I navigate around your tattoos
Said you got that one on a whim
When you were breaking up with him
And that Matryoshka Russian doll
That lines your shelf from big to small
What a way to start anew
To shed your skin and find the old you

Everybody wants to get famous
But you just want to dance in a basement
You don't care if anyone is watching
Just as long as you stay in motion
We put miles on these old jean jackets
Got caught up in the drunk conversations
But after the party, it's me and you
After the party, it's me and you

With a new outlook on everything we see
From high upon this rooftop over South Philly
To the nights we lose our self-control
From the sex, from the drugs, from the rock and roll

Everybody wants to get famous
But you just want to dance in a basement
You don't care if anyone is watching
Just as long as you stay in motion

Got caught up in the drunk conversations
But after the party, it's me and you
After the party, it's me and you
After the party, it's me and you

Swingin’ and swayin’ to the murder mystery
Rhyme and reason fled the crime scene
Of new penthouses next to tents in the streets
Oh, how do I steer my early 30’s
Before I shipwreck, before I'm 40
Oh, ain’t it a shame what we choose to ignore
What kind of monsters did our parents vote for?

Lately I feel like I’m in puppet Vichy France
Tryin’ to teach the devil how to dance

To these sing-alongs of siren songs
To ooh’s, to ahh’s

With all of my anger I scream and shout

Ooh-oh-oh-oh

Driving through the Bible Belt
Billboards claiming how Jesus felt
Oh, how’d his words confuse themselves?
With cranks for Christians in powerful positions

I’ve always felt like all their pomp and circumstance
Is just cover for the devil to dance

To these sing-alongs of siren songs
To ooh’s to ahh’s

Back to the times, first moving in with you

Please come back to Philadelphia
This place ain’t the same without you Anna

You got a great big new promotion
But now you travel so damn much
It's like our studio apartment
Is just a place to keep your stuff
And when you’re away, I walk around in a haze
Reminiscing the days, first moving in with you

I have so much to tell ya
Please come back to Philadelphia
This place ain’t the same without you Anna
And oh, how the neighborhood's changed
And all our friends keep asking for ya
This place ain’t the same without you Anna

Take as long as you need to take
I’ll be fine on my own
Counting down the days until you come home

You can't touch us, we're untouchable
Lament the beginnings that we celebrate
Never afraid, we're fearless together

Gold has us slurring and pissing out windows
Enemies are so far away
We're alive

And drive around with just a half a pack of smokes
Bottle of Clear Eyes and appetite

Wouldn't you guess the only thing we had to fear
Would be flashing their lights in the rearview mirror
This time they got us
It's all over now
You were praying Hail Marys for an escape route
But thank God for your father's last name
And all the connections that he's made
To everyone, you're such a sweet church girl
But I know your secret

Bad Catholics, weren't we, darling?
Always dipping out before communion started
Bad Catholics, weren't we, darling?
Always dipping out before communion started

Another summer and another church picnic
I watch a mother run around in a panic
Chasing a kid with his orange soda mustache
While his father's by the gambling wheel
There I saw you in the beer tent
Hanging with your new husband and your baby on the way
Oh it's kind of strange how it made me miss something
Long lost in the both of us now
You thank God that I found my way
You introduce me to what's his name
To everyone you're a sweet church girl, but I know your secret

Bad Catholics, weren't we, darling?
Always dipping out before communion started

Into the procession of a black mass
Oh how the subject at the altar wants their life back
The view from here to there is a lot like wilting flowers
It's bored beyond repair and unfit for an altar
It's strange relating with the lamb to the slaughter

But hey, do you really want to throw it away?
Do you really want to throw it away?
I'd do anything to make you stay

We used to only take the back roads
But now we found a distance shorter
You used to call me darling
Now you prefer more formal
We used to get high and stare at the moon
And wonder how long it would take to walk to
But now that's like the distance between me and you

But hey, do you really want to throw it away?

Felt the sister's pain then it fell apart
We were told one thing and they showed us another
Is it finally true, we're not getting any younger?

The boy blue with the silver spoon
They found him dying in the living room
Say goodbye to the bride and groom
Send them off on their honeymoon

Dreadful sound echoed through the trees
Dirty headlights put us on our knees
Route 502, we were waiting for you
But you couldn't see
It was New Year's Eve
Wait with me

The boy blue with the silver spoon
They found him dying in the living room
Say goodbye to the bride and groom
Send them off on their honeymoon

I've been told there's no going home
No room for you and me
No empty seats in eternity
I've been told no going home
No song left to sing
No second act to mortality

From a song that I once heard
The same melody I borrowed from the void
I'd rather observe than structure a narrative
The characters are thin
The plot does not develop
It ends where it begins
It's on the screen, in paperbacks
In section 8 and cul-de-sacs
Electro haikus and drunk sonnets
Are moving me along
Along
You cut my hair
You left red ink everywhere
Do my hands tell a story?
Is it boring?
You cut my hair
You left red ink everywhere
Do my hands tell a story?
Is it boring you?
What I'd give to force your sigh
What I'd give to see you cry
What I'd give for your caress
To see your blue cotton dress
Balled up on the floor
Certain memories are the problem
Certain drunken lines are the shame
Seven hundred miles and four years
I can't fight the flame; it burns
And it burns and it burns and it burns
You cut my hair
You left red ink everywhere
Do my hands tell a story?
Is it boring?
You cut my hair
You left red ink everywhere
Do my hands tell a story?
Is it boring you?

On the long ride back to Philly
From the way that you'd wear your hair
From the way that you'd laugh when you drank too much
Before the plug was pulled, the fires burned out
And all the parties grew bored
You waited tables and I waited for your shift breaks

And Gin and Casey
Used to dance inside of me
And I bet I sound like a broken record
Every time I open my mouth
I want to wander around the city with you again
Like when you waited tables
And I waited for your shift breaks

Me and Casey
We used to get drunk before we did the dishes
Oh, every evening
Me and Casey
Used to get high and listen to our boredom
'Cause it was so much easier
'Cause it was so much easier
Than dealing with everything

So Casey, Casey, Casey
Just tell me when you're ready, I'm all packed to go
To search for that old place we found forever ago
We could take my car 'cause she's still got the spirit
We could live, we could live, we could live
And no longer just have to hear it

Me and Casey
We used to get drunk before we did the dishes
Oh, every evening
Me and Casey
Used to get high and listen to our boredom

Driving into Scranton for a difficult occasion
When you first got your license we were nowhere to be found
I was just a little kid back then but you let me hang around
But we’re older now

Farewell youth, I’m afraid I hardly got to know you
I was always hanging out with the older kids
Always in a rush, but I was never sure from what
I was always hanging out with the older kids

The grief starts when bumping into friends turned acquaintances
We stumble around the small talk
We break the silence with Jameson
But once we were inseparable
We were the only punks in town
We spent every weekend raisin’ hell in the basement of your parents house
But we’re older now

Farewell youth, I’m afraid I hardly got to know you
I was always hanging out with the older kids
Always in a rush, but I was never sure from what
I was always hanging out with the older kids

In someone's apartment, getting fucked up
To all our favorite records, drinking the cheap stuff
We couldn’t get enough of growing up
I saw my childhood flash before me in the death of your closed eyes
At your Irish wake we celebrate by trying not to cry

Farewell youth, I’m afraid I hardly got to know you
I was always hanging out with the older kids
Always in a rush, but I was never sure from what
I was always hanging out with the older kids

Specialist Jeg, a much more honest man than you
Came back from the desert where he never found the truth
Now he screeches tires, fills his head with alcohol
While the morbid brown faces hang like portraits on the wall

McTiernan was a good ol' boy, he cheated and he skimmed
""A favor for a favor, it can't be called a sin""
Some may see it different, and some don't see at all
When the papers started calling, he closed his eyes and took the fall

Had it all, took the fall
Had it all, took the fall

Now we're standing on the ledge and we're looking at the ground
I feel my body breaking on the asphalt, hear the sound
Red and blue lights screaming saying step up off that ledge
So we wrap our hearts up in our heads and take the fall instead

For getting drunk round the back of the Lions' Club
Waiting for the shitty bands to finish up
And some kids played hacky sack while the others just got high

When you both smoke, smoke the same cigarettes
You'll get seated as diner's lovers
She'll get the check as friends for the better
You'll carve your names into the Paupack cliffs

Towards the Great White North or a border town in Mexico

The Menzingers,I Can’t Seem to Tell,On the Impossible Past,2012-02-21,"One, two, three, four!

Well, the silence hasn't been broken
As we reach the point of utter disgust
As the weeks drag on, the lies unfold
The alcohol loses its touch
And I once held your words close to my heart
With a knife protecting all of them
But now we've made our beds in a deep, dense forest
We're sound, we'll never take the blame

As I dig my hands in the cold, dark dirt
In a search for what's now lost forever
With one last great hope of a messiah
I check the time and admit to the surrender terms
Remember the days when I had a conscience? Yeah, me neither
And I'm warning, I'm warning, I'm warning you
And I'm warning, I'm warning, I'm warning you

That I can't seem to tell
I can't seem to tell, I can't seem to tell
If it's my head or the earth that's spinning around
Well, I can't seem to tell, I can't seem to tell
I can't seem to tell anymore

The Menzingers,I Can’t Stop Drinking,Hello Exile,2019-10-04,"Champagne drunk, tomorrow is out of luck
When  the celebrations come to an end
When  the party's over, Sunday morning wakes up sober
Begs for me to start up again
I’m whiskey drunk in the Shop Rite parking lot
I’m  waiting while Anna buys milk and eggs
Sometimes  I wonder why she hasn’t found another
One that her girlfriends would recommend

Our  worst fights are when we get silent
Just a disappointed you shaking your head
When the cards and flowers don’t work
I sleep on the couch when I’m a jerk
What's  gotta give, what's gotta give

‘Cause I know what you’re thinking
That I can’t stop drinking
Every time you try and ask me to
I just throw a fit and storm out of the room
‘Cause I know what you’re thinking

I’m cheap beer drunk in a bar off Passyunk
I’ll be here until the lights come up again
Feel free to join me if you’re bored or feeling lonely
I could sure use the company
I miss you so much when I was your drunk lush
You knew me so well, I knew you half as well
Love’s a cruel, cruel joke when the tools in the shed can’t fix what’s broke
So you leave it broke

‘Cause I know what you’re thinking
That I can’t stop drinking
Every time you try and ask me to
I just throw a fit and storm out of the room
‘Cause I know what you’re thinking"
The Menzingers,I Don’t Wanna Be an Asshole Anymore,Rented World,2014-04-22,"Yeeeeahhhhh!
Last Friday night I wasn't me
I was a still life trapped in eternity
I was the focal point out of focus, out of ink
And I've been wandering nightly
Through the garden of your heartache
Always making a mess, always stumbling out the door
But, I don't wanna be an asshole anymore

Baby, baby I'll be good to you
I don't wanna be an asshole anymore
Baby, baby, I'll be good to you
Baby, baby, I'll be good to you

Another night, I devoured the sun
And plunged myself into the depths of oblivion
Yeah somewhere along the way I found wine
Feels damn good just to bleed sometimes
But all I ever wanted was to make things right
The years of idleness and spite
I push my emotions off a bridge
After taking them hostage with a shotgun
Now they're somewhere treading water
Somewhere lost inside the man that I'm not
But I don't wanna be an asshole anymore

Baby, baby I'll be good to you
I don't wanna be an asshole anymore
Baby, baby, I'll be good to you
I'll be good to you, I'll be good, I'll be good, I'll be good

I won't lie no more about where I've been
And I won't pry no more
Over the people that you're hanging with
You're the only lover that I ever missed
Ever been hopelessly in love with
Look at this tangle of thorns
I don't wanna be an asshole anymore

Yeah, I don't wanna be an asshole anymore
Oh no, no, no"
The Menzingers,In Remission,Rented World,2014-04-22,"I've got a winning lotto ticket
From the state of Massachusetts
Tucked in the back of my wallet
I'll cash it when I'm back in Boston
With a blank eye from the cashier
For why it's torn and busted up

I remember that moment of silence
I was at a mall in Norwich
Shoppers stared at the ground
The escalators went on smoke breaks
Oh 1918, you've yet to see the worst of humans acting

Maybe the future's just a little bit weird
Maybe the God you love is all I've got to fear
Life's a terminal illness in remission
So I took the weight of it all out for a drink
And then we drove back, drunk
Through the busy city streets

I hate how I always get nervous
Every time I try to speak
In front of a big crowd
A pretty girl, or the police
And I hate the things that I know about you
And all the horrible things that you do

I don't want to be late for war today
I want to chew up my dinner and spit in your face
Light fire to your home and tap your cell phone
Oh yeah!

If everyone needs a crutch
Then I need a wheelchair
I need a reason to reason with you
If everyone needs a crutch
Then I need a wheelchair
I need a reason to reason with you

I killed another man
Pictures carved in stone
See your reflection in your phone
And know we're not alone

Cemetery walls
Klonopin and alcohol
Tonight I won't start a fight
You barely made a sound
We put your mother in the ground
Some words are never found

Promises were made on an alter in blood
Sacrificial children's voices echo on and on
We're the last to know, we're the last to know

They told us who we are
In spiral ladders to the stars
Collect our memories
We'll be back again
Each time a little different
It ends where it begins

God, I despise their reassuring, lying eyes
Our home stands tall behind that foreclosure sign
Everything in boxes from another lifetime
Continental breakfast in the lobby
But they're always out of coffee
Only a fool would think living could be easy
Only a fool would think living could be easy
This little motel room on I-80 west of nowhere
Why count the stars?
You'll never know where you are
Somewhere light years from the world you used to know
Like a lock that doesn't turn
Like a plant that doesn't grow
Long for the words with hearts and wings
From five states over, I'm running from everything
Continental breakfast in the lobby
But they're always out of coffee
Only a fool would think living could be easy
Only a fool would think living could be easy
Oh you know it breaks my heart
Watching your whole life fall apart
While bastards dance off with the night
As we try to break free with all our might
Only a fool would think living could be easy

And now we’re sitting in the back of the theater
Binging everything that’s left to drink

And drink with on random neighbors' porch steps
Our glossy eyes painted portraits of the streets

You were an old friend that covered up your innocence
With bad tattoos of all the bands you loved in high school
The ones you said that I had to listen to all the time

I did what I did to get away from this
'Cause everything that's happened has left me a total wreck
And everything that I do now is meaningless
So I'm off to wander around the world for a little bit
Without one hundred channels with nothing on the TV
And the great pessimistic unknown

So does anyone know the best way to go?
Which road that I could take to get to Mexico?
'Cause I'm so sick of living in this ditch
With only the memory in the back of my head
I'm on cruise control and the radio was on
Yeah, they were playing that song
That we both learned on our Mexican guitars

We both got worthless diplomas from worthless universities
Two bachelors in worthless studies
But at least it made our parents happy
And cost a whole lot of money

Denver if we get tired
Said you didn't mind stopping just as long as we got out of the midwest states

Some nights trash reality or kids cartoons or shitty documentaries
Not perfect but we're good together
Yeah, me, you, and our bad tattoos
Yeah, all our stick and pokes, all our inside jokes
We'll regret them when we're dead and sober

Dreaming their dreams? Singing songs of another time?
Is your gold so strangely acquired?
Has your name become known and desired?
Have you degenerated? Are you running out of time?

Do you call nice things your own?

As the image of a former you
Searching every nook and every cranny
For the form that I'm taking

But baby, baby I'm right here!
I try to shout and scream and say
But my darling you just swat
You just swat me away
And in my greatest desperation
I dig deep into your skin
A little itch to keep the thought of me

Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good

Exhaled by drunk twentysomethings
There's a couple arguing in the bathroom
A couple kids just trying to get high
I try to make my way outside
'Cause I've got to see you tonight
I start pacing then running

""But baby, baby buzz me in!""
I ring your intercom and say
But you just poke your head through the curtain
And my heart's on the floor

Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good anymore
Nothing feels good

Like the dead cat in the alley
Like the garbage overturned
Like the uninviting orgy
On top of some dog shit in the yard

I thought my house could never burn

Can't stand these people no more
But you cannot leave when you can't find the door
Smashed my phone, lost my wallet
Who's this new friend of mine?
Why do some people make you nervous
And others drive you to drink when the bars are closing?
Nightstand memorial to past libation
A sudden fear of phone vibrations
Too hung over to sleep
Too tired to stay alive
Benzos, bile, and bills
There's so much missing time to kill
I shake like an airplane on its way down
Why do some people make you nervous
And others drive you to drink when the bars are closing?
When the bars are closing
No good'll come from stumbling home with the sun
No good'll come from stumbling home with the sun
I used to care
Now I stare into the sunken eyes and strangers' faces
I fall asleep in the strangest places
What the hell am I doing?
Where have my friends gone?

And others drive you to drink when the bars are closing?

That lit up New York City
From a rooftop in Brooklyn
That was covered in bad graffiti
And then I let a thousand splinters
Pierce right through my spoiled liver
Whatever that was left of it

Cause I cursed my lonely memory
With picture-perfect imagery
Maybe I'm not dying
I'm just living in decaying cities
But I'm still healthy, I'm still fine
I've been spending all my time
Reading the obituaries

But I will fuck this up, I fucking know it
I will fuck this up, I fucking know it
I will fuck this up, I fucking know it
I will fuck this up, I fucking know it

Cause I am the shadow of the waxwing, slain
I felt the false azure from window panes
I am just freaking out, yeah I'll be fine

Sinner's smile and open arms
Drop a line to charm the silent alarm
Neutral angels calling the cops
They'll be choosing sides when the fighting stops
Polizia in the cabaret
While we six kings made our getaway

Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between
Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between
With an ocean in between

Laughter in the darkness
Whispers in the shadows
I was there when the wall fell down
I'll be there when the ocean rises
Building castles of cans and bottles
Drinking like they do in novels
Know they'll catch me by and by
But tonight you are my alibi

Same old sun that we all come from
Faded stars in the air that we breathe
In the earth, in the sea

Thick as thieves, on our knees
With an ocean in between

The Menzingers,Time Tables,Chamberlain Waits,2010-04-13,"Once she came like a vision in the night
I fell in love before the morning arrived
She wore a blue dress to combat the heat
Drank beer from a bottle and danced in the street
Then I heard her singing something fairly familiar
A tale of two lovers in the thick of the summer
There in the moment, we kissed in the hammock
We argued over which Bad Religion album was better
Well, I thought ‘No Control’ or ‘Suffer’
And then she became queen of the neighborhood parties
'Cause I was an unknown boy along for the ride
Kept the guitar right by my side
It was better than conversing with the kids I didn’t like
But on the fourth of July, when the fireworks rang out
She met a new boy who was more hip and less strung out
I drove home with fire in the sky
Fiddled with the dials and stumbled across something
That you were always humming
As time tables suggest
We were only just friends
In constant motions, covering stilts
I’ll give you a dollar for another ride home
Or something to mix with your Coke
Well maybe if you want to wander around outside tonight
Meet me in Lake Ariel after midnight
Or really whenever, I only want to talk
I only want to relive what was lost
As time tables suggest
We were only just friends
In constant motions, covering stilts
I’ll give you a dollar for another ride home
Or something to mix with...

From a night I spent sober, screaming ""I'm gonna die.""

All I ever wanted was to make things right

Transient love, I was a ghost on your birthday
I was a runaway, somewhere in a grave of mistakes
Transient love, you should've seen the view from the mansion
It made me think of things we never mentioned
The things we're too afraid to say

Like what if I spend the next few years
Just somewhere in some atmosphere
While you're at home with bills to pay
I hope it doesn't end this way

Made it to the gate with record timing

I was on my way to heaven when you died
I was dressed in all black and I hoped
That nobody would notice me or the boltcutters I was hiding
Underneath my oversized jacket
I snuck around the back and broke you out when the gods weren't looking
I was on my way to heaven when you died
But then it was all over
They got us surrounded
They beat us with batons
Cuffed us and threw us in the car
When I wake up I want to talk to a lawyer
I demand a fair and speedy trial

How do you keep them alive?
How do you make sure that something like this won't ever happen again?

She's always on my mind
She is a rose and I am a stone
She's always poking her head out
And striking a pose
I'm always plucking her petals
And some nights we fall out of love
Some nights I sleep in her arms
Some nights I sleep
Some nights I sleep on the couch

Well I spent that night in our past life
Wringing out the years from our shoes
In the distance you lived with my signature
Penned on a treaty that kept our armies at rest
But I was a pushy little one
When you tried to find someone new
I just kind of waited around for you
Because what else was I suppose to
What else was I supposed to do?

I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists

I saw it in your face the day we parked your car
On the shoulder by the reservoir
And in my mouth, my words did hide
For fear of being recognized

I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists
It's when you are alone and when you're around me
I know where your heartache exists"
The Menzingers,Your Wild Years,After the Party,2017-02-03,"Long for the words with hearts and wings
Something familiar when you miss everything
You rest your head against the window pane
Feet on the dash through the steady rain
I drove you home while you slept in the front seat
After a show at the Stone Pony
Watch you awake so god damn sweetly
Over the Walt Whitman Bridge back to Philly

I toss and turn at four in the morning
Petrified of where our future's going
'Cause you're the kind of girl that deserves the world
I'm just the kind of guy that promises the world
So I fix a drink nice and strong in the kitchen
Something quick that'll cure my conscience
Creep back to bed and I kiss your forehead
Maybe everything is fine and it's all in my head

A little Irish in your blood
A little Polish in your name
A little Boston in your attitude
Just the way you were raised

A little Polish in your name
A little Boston in your attitude

We drove up to Massachusetts together
Your old house was just like you remember
We stayed in your adolescent room
Rummaged through the boxes labeled ""former you""
The souvenirs of happiness in the moment
Your wild years that you often mention
The sands of time in an hourglass
That you're always begging for back
I got drunk in the afternoon
With your father in the living room
As the television broke the silence
You smiled, knowing that I was trying
The best that I can do

A little Irish in your blood
A little Polish in your name
A little Boston in your attitude
Just the way you were raised
A little Irish in your blood
A little Polish in your name

Watch from the back porch

You stop to smile

If that ain't home
I don't know what is

Long blonde hair
And your sun-tanned skin
Bare foot in
Your little yellow dress
The summer rain makes the sound of the trees
I see you laughing
As you come running in

Staring at the dead leaves in a backyard pool
Where did my life go?
What a spectacular view
All those old Irish songs at my grandfather's funeral
Seventeen candles on a birthday cake
Seems like yesterday

Fell in and out of love and hard drugs
Found my heart in Los Angeles

I don't have any answers for you kid
I'm still figuring out what I'm doing here
Keep your home in your heart
It keeps you out of the rain
Don't let those sad songs rot your brain

I'll hold the wheel while you light your cigarette
Burning down the highway out of here
My twenties clipping at my heels
I've been killing myself just to know how it feels

Laid out on my childhood bed
To the sound of “Sam's Town” and my hands behind my head

I don't have any answers for you kid
I'm still figuring out what I'm doing here
Keep your home in your heart
It keeps you out of the rain
Don't let those sad songs rot your brain

Ask me again why I'm never really here
Nothing has to leave when it lives in my head
Ask me again why I'm never really here
Nothing lives forever, but it lives in my head

I don't have any answers for you kid
I'm still figuring out what I'm doing here
Keep your home in your heart

Who blames his broken home

I was happy on my own
I never asked for your help
Thought I could handle this myself
But you poisoned me to think
That I was nothing without you
You lied to me
I took the blame
Drinking soon became a part of me
A kid, who thought he threw his life away
You moved out
'Cause I had problems that you couldn't change
But now you say I'm not the fucking same I used to be
I don't need fixing
When I don't fit
Into the shape you moulded
You tell your friends

Another night inside my head

And I can't go back there again

But you always had time for me
It rained nearly every day then
Desperate for a means to an end
Anything that we could manage
To make it stop

Everything I'd ever get to feel
The memory numbs me still
And I can't go back there again
The tiny room upstairs

Midday
At Flirtation hill
Sitting in your car
You asked me what was wrong
I said I'm tired of waking up
You sped at the fence
That bordered the edge
And when I begged you to stop
You looked at me and said
“Don't say it if you don't mean it.”

How can we say that we were unprepared
I made the best of all the chances given

That place that we once knew is gone
We left it there nothing but a hole in the ground
It wasn’t where that we came from
It always felt like when that we called home

They made us family and brought us this far
We ripped our skin so we can’t shake it off

The taste of cigarettes
Bottle in hand
And disappointed friends

From my last cigarette
I'll fight my last fight
In a desperate attempt
To prove that I'm worth it
Worth your attention
Portrayed my rendition
Of a broken boy
I'm so tired of hiding
Behind my pen
It only goes to paper
What comes off my chest
But I can't forget
I've struggled to find a place that I could stay
Because settling has never been an option for me
I'd trade it in to never feel afraid
But everything goes away

To break away
From this fucking pattern

I couldn't quite manage it back then
If only you could see now what I can do
Mum still has your old handbag
With all of your jewellery in it
I gave your pearl earrings
To the girl I love
On her 21st birthday
And all the car trips on rainy days
Trying to find where the rainbow begins
It's my warmest memory
When mum could no longer take care of you
We had to say our goodbyes at the nursing home
You didn't know why you can't come back with us
I've never seen my mother cry so much
And I watched grandpa visit you every day he could
He would stop by the bar on his way home
When the days weren't so good
Time alone so he wouldn't forget
What it was like when you remembered him
I didn't answer the phone
He walked home
And he died of a stroke
And mum gave you his wedding ring
Mum made it to a show last month
She said you'd be so proud"
Trophy Eyes,Nose Bleed,Chemical Miracle,2016-10-14,"Typical me in the nosebleeds
Late to my own funeral
Down, down in front
A childhood flash in front of me
No matter how hard you try
You just can't fix what isn't there
I'll never love you like a father
But I'll love you like a friend
I'll learn to love you if it kills me

Taught to run
And die alone
Left you wasted by the phone
You sure made men out of us
Taught to run
And die alone
Left you wasted by the phone
You sure made men out of us

Typical me in the palm trees
Got no time for anyone
Call, call your son
And break your heart with the message tone
A heavy hand makes the man
I know you knew no different
So I can't hate you for it
But I can't help the distance

Taught to run
And die alone
Left you wasted by the phone
You sure made men out of us
Taught to run
And die alone
Left you wasted by the phone
You sure made men out of us

Friend
I'll learn to love you if it kills me

Taught to run
And die alone
Left you wasted by the phone
You sure made men out of us
Taught to run
And die alone
Left you wasted by the phone
You sure made men out of us"
Trophy Eyes,Penfold State Forest,"Mend, Move On",2014-11-04,"Staring at a blue lined page
Trying to find the answers in ink
What would I leave behind
If I was to die today?
But I'm strong enough to say
That I have plenty of regrets
And maybe I can never change
My whole life will be a waste
What did I do with the years
Now that I'm pushing 23
And I still can't tell the difference
Between the right and the wrong thing
How did I get so fucking good
At hurting everyone I love?
Is that all I'll be remembered for?
And I'm tired of writing sad songs
'Cause that's all that I have left
And it's the things that I reflect on
That make me who I am
It happened again
Restless in my sleep
You woke me from a dream
To say I'm not like my old man
And maybe that's what I'm so scared of
That I'll be no different
I'll bring someone into this life
And leave a scar they can't forget
I ran my thumb over the faces in
My old class photo
We were so innocent back then
If only I had known
And all those smiles staring back at me
Where the fuck did they all go?
What I would do for a clear conscience again
To swallow the lump that's in my throat
I'm tired of writing sad songs
'Cause that's all that I have left
And it's the things that I reflect on
That make me who I am
And the first time we drove past
Penfold State Forest
I felt the weight of another life
Leave my back finally
Is this all I'll be remembered for?
The scar they can’t forget"
Trophy Eyes,Personal Taste,Demo 2013,2013-04-08,"You can come with me or drown
Let your insecurities pull you down
I’m not waiting any longer for you
While you sit in your mess and wait for miracles to
Take you back
Drinking on your own is only bringing you down
We’ve all passed you by years but your still around
It’s time to grow up get out of this fucking town
But you’re too busy on your own forgetting dignity counts
Your life’s been slipping through your hands since we left
You never paid much attention but it hurts more to pretend
Cause one day you will wake and realised all you had was the chance to let it all go or stay true to your friends
But you slipped again
I can tell by your vacant expression that the years spent in your head haven’t treated you kind
And what we all wouldn’t give just to listen once more before the tape unwinds
It gets easier to just let go than watch everything you love slip through your hands
I guess it’s better off as memories
But you’ll have to grow up to understand
You’ll have to grow up to understand
Drinking on your own is only bringing you down
We’ve all passed you by years but your still around
It’s time to grow up get out of this fucking town
But you’re too busy on your own forgetting dignity counts
Your ignorance a vessel that has run aground
I’m were so sick of your lies you’ve grown close to the sound
I couldn’t care any less for the safety you’ve found
Surrounded by your stories with your head in the clouds
You’ll have to grow up to understand
You’ll have to grow up to understand"
Trophy Eyes,Rain On Me,Chemical Miracle,2016-10-14,"Rain
Rain on me
Every raindrop that touches my skin
Makes a sound like your name
Makes a sound like your name

It made a hole inside of me
A hungry aching void
That clamoured to be filled
And only found easement in your voice

I'll keep the world awake
For taking me away
As long as there's breath left in me
None shall sleep
Stay
I'll be your favourite mistake

I can feel it deep inside of me
I can feel it burning in my skin
But I'm too old - too firmly moulded
To say how you make me feel


Stay
I'll be your favourite mistake"

But it saved my life
And the lights outside my window
Help me sleep at night
'Cause when the lights go out
It all comes crashing in
Just how lucky I am
To still be breathing in
And the footsteps as I walk towards my front door
The key slips
The lock scratched
The sound so familiar
'Cause I traded in my jacket
For a newfound sense of freedom
'Cause winters, they don't
Scare me like the used to anymore
And I sold my guitar
'Cause I don't really write so much anymore
And I've kind of grown accustomed
To the noises in my head
I gave up searching
I think I'm happy with who I am
Even though I chewed up
And spat out my family and friends
I've still got my whole life
To make it up and make amends
I know it's not much to you
But maybe you could understand
I breathe in
This city
And look at what I've started
I think I've spent enough hours
Killing myself
Over what I thought you saw in me
And when I leave
I try to keep it off my mind
That the rain back home
Swallowed all I left behind
I gave up searching
I think I'm happy with who I am
Even though I chewed up
And spat out my family and friends
I've still got my whole life
To make it up and make amends
I know it's not much to you

Help me sleep at night
It's like I'm standing on the edge of a life to be
And whatever happens next was always up to me
No longer will I compare myself
To establish my self worth"

But it will all come together when the lights go out
It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out

A short walk to the corner store
To spend the small change in my hand
A young man tore his body apart
Right in front of my house on the train tracks
The suits turned their heads to the smell of death
For broken bones, or a spot of blood
And police lights, flash like Christmas nights
In celebration that it wasn't me, this time

Waking up in the same old skin
It ain't easy to believe
We were born for something bigger than this

It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out
It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out

I imagine a pale square of paint in the hallway
Where your portrait used to hang
Your family couldn't stand the heartache
So they took your picture down and left your room the same
I ain't ever left a scar like that
But that's all we have when people think of us when we're dead
We all find ourselves at the train tracks
The good die young and the old die bitter singing

It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out
It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out
It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out
It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out

And my life flashed before my eyes
And I didn't care how we left it
I'm still flying through my twenties
Waiting for someone to say I made it
Golden boy, tiny pay check
Big ideas and broken heartstrings
Waking up in the same old skin
It ain't easy to believe
We were born for something bigger than this

It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out
It don't make much sense right now
But it will all come together when the lights go out

And sound like a passing train
With my head outside the car
In the back seat
I threw a bottle from the window
Just to watch it break
It bounced and retained it's shape
Would my body do the same?
Please just drive this car into a wall
Anything to break the silence
We could die on impact
Or we could just drive straight through

Pick your bones up off the street
Take the car back before someone knows it's missing
Burn it out on the side of the road
We know that's what you're good at
Make your annual escape from home
Before they know what hit them

Walk on your friends to fly
We've run out of reasons for watching you die

We were just children
When I held your hand
I promised if you go then I go the same
What a stupid way to see
If your friends can keep their promises
Aren't you tired of hospital beds?

I know the feeling man
You can't count the fuck ups on two hands

Like running water
What are you running from?

What a stupid way to see
If your friends can keep their promises

If you go
I go

By my phone

I got this heart-shaped hole
And I know you don't have the time

What I wouldn't give to argue now

So I take the problems inside my head
And swap it for what the bottle used to have

Well, I'd trade them all and the pictures drawn
In the condensation on my window to see you standing there

Tell me you still need me

For the only reason I found sleep
In the past three years
And I owe that charade
For the distance that I keep

There's no shortage of new faces
And so many places I've never been
But he one place I keep inside my head
Is where the sun shines through your white curtains
And the breeze that lifts them off the wall
And gently wakes me up to the world
To an overwhelming smell of home
But I can't be there for long
And I never wanted to be the one that only lets you down
And a promise that I can keep is that my feet won't find the ground
But your heart can't see the damage done when I'm around"
